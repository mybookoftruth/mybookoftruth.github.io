		<p>My dearly beloved daughter since time began and when the world was created by My Eternal Father there has been much confusion about the origin of the human race.</p>
<p>When My Father created the world so that He could have a family much preparation was made.</p>
<p>He created the earth, the seas, the plants, the trees, the mountains, the rivers, the animals and then, on the second last day, when all was in place in Paradise, He created man.<br>
<strong><br>
Man, while stained with sin, is a sacred creature. Animals are there to serve mankind. </strong></p>
<p>Man did not evolve from animals but that is what those, who do not believe in God, would have you believe.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution theories, which claim that man came from animals, is a lie. <strong>They can never be proved.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Satan, his fallen angels and every devil which springs from the enemy of God, has convinced man of this terrible lie</strong>.</p>
<p>Man is a child of God but in order to demean the human child of God, Satan wants to create confusion in the hearts of humanity.</p>
<p>Why does he promote this lie through false teachings? So he can prove that man evolved from apes and then convince them that they were not created by the Hand of My Eternal Father.</p>
<p>This is one of the greatest lies perpetrated by the devil using the souls of those men who claim they are more intelligent than the rest of their brothers and sisters.<br>
<strong><br>
Scientists declare that man evolved from animal but they are being deceived.</strong></p>
<p>Science is flawed when it attempts to declare the truth about the creation of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>No man understands the miracle of Divine Creation. </strong></p>
<p><strong>If man believes he knows all the answers about the origins of humanity, based on human reasoning, then he deceives not only other poor souls, but himself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When there is no love of God present in such souls who believe in the superiority of human intelligence then atheism spreads like a weed. </strong></p>
<p>This weed, which grows in every direction contaminates and destroys every crop in sight and creates disease.</p>
<p>The only cure is to seek help from God through humble prayer and ask that the Truth be revealed.</p>
<p>So many untruths spread by atheists, who try to prove that God does not exist, have destroyed millions of souls. Their victims need your prayers.</p>
<p><strong>Atheism is the biggest religion in the world and those who have devoted  their lives to this deceit are lost for eternity.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>They will face the fires of Hell.</p>
<p>Unless they turn to Me, during or after The Warning, they will suffer a terrible chastisement.</p>
<p>Pray for them.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
