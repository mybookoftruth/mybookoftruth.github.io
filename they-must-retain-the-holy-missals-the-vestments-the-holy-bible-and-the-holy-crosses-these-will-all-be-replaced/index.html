		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, many of those who are blessed with a strong faith and love for Me, Jesus Christ, are finally beginning to recognise My Voice, as I speak to the world through these Messages.</p>
<p>Those who spend their lives slavishly serving the serpent know also that it is I Who speaks. And so the battle to do My Holy Will, on the one hand, and the desire by the enemies of God to fight Me, begins.</p>
<p><strong>Those who are planning to inflict suffering upon humanity, as part of a covenant with the beast, will be careful not to be seen to denounce these Messages publicly, as by doing so, they will give credence to them.</strong> Instead, they will spread hatred against Me in other ways, starting by destroying the faith of those within My Church. They will turn the hearts of those who love Me against their fellow Christians. <strong>They will embrace pagans, new age witches and worshipers of the beast, rather than Christians, who will object to the vile pagan rituals, which will be performed in Catholic Churches and soon other Christian churches.</strong></p>
<p>These events are still to come. Please do not think that the current Holy Masses or Sacraments have changed yet, although they will change very soon. When they do, you must turn your back and defend Me.</p>
<p><strong>Much change has been planned for the last few years by the evil of Masonry in My Church on Earth.</strong> <strong>Now their plans, already made known within the highest ranks in the churches, are about to be announced. They will be unveiled with the announcement that the Catholic Church is being modernized, so that it can become relevant in today’s new, open-minded, liberal society.</strong> It will say, it will be putting the past behind and it will then say that its motto will be to embrace all creeds, to show that it is not narrow in attitude. This announcement will be celebrated all over the world and the media will cover this great news on its front pages, when before it viewed the Catholic Church with distaste.</p>
<p>The seed of Satan will be spent and the new ceremonies, where the format of the Holy Masses will be presented backwards, but all the correct phrases relating to My Passion will be substituted with nonsense – empty words – empty vessels – empty tabernacles. All My Crosses will be replaced with the secret symbols of the occult.</p>
<p>This is the desolation spoken of to the prophet Daniel. <strong>This is the end of My Holy Eucharist and the end of the Mass, as you know it, in many places. But My beloved loyal servants will prepare now, the production of the Holy Hosts. They must retain the Holy Missals, the vestments, the Holy Bible and the Holy Crosses.</strong> These will all be replaced.</p>
<p>You must gather soon and plan, for you will not be allowed to say Mass according to My Will.</p>
<p>I will guide you, My sacred servants, when the time comes. To those Christians who believe that this abomination will only be seen in the Catholic Church, then know that it will affect all Christian churches, until they banish all mentions of, or signs of, Me. In time, you will be severely punished for mentioning My Name.</p>
<p>You will be shocked at how quickly the seemingly innocent, renewed, but contaminated, Church will descend into a wicked cult. They will go to extraordinary lengths to punish those who will defy their manmade, pagan, new world religion.</p>
<p>Christians and Jews will be the main target of hatred and they will be persecuted because of their religion.</p>
<p>Instead of being fearful, I Call you to be prepared to fight for My Name. Never forget how much I Am still hated. Know when you follow Me, in these times which lie ahead, your cross will be much heavier than those who came before you.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
