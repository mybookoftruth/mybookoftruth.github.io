		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, tell all of My followers – all those who believe in Me, Jesus Christ – that they must allocate time each day to Me in prayer, in order to save the souls of those who are lost to Me. By the Graces, which I give to you, I desire that in return, you will help to bring Me the souls of those who break My Heart.</p>
<p>I must ask that you endure the pain you will feel, because of the separation of humanity from Me, Jesus Christ. This will be caused by the schism in My Church on Earth. By accepting this suffering with complete submission, I can conquer the grip, which the evil one exerts over those who are too weak to proclaim the True Word of God. <b>You must never fear this Mission, for it is given to the world because of the Generosity of My beloved Father. He simply wants to reclaim His Creation, intact, so as not to lose one single child of His.</b></p>
<p><b>No matter who scourges you, mocks you or persecutes you, just remember the punishment, which befalls all those who spit in My Face. Then, ignoring the taunts, you must pray fervently for each of these poor souls.</b> Be generous in heart and you will be filled with the Holy Spirit, so that then you will fight, alongside My Heavenly Army, to salvage the world from evil. You must await therefore, with love and trust, and I will bring you great Blessings.<b></b></p>
<p>Hope must never be discarded because of fear. Fear must never blind you to the task which is required of you, so when I come as the King of Mercy, not one soul will be left in any doubt as to Who I Am and What I Am. Gather together. Unite. Bring all souls into My Merciful Arms. To help Me do this, you must recite this special Crusade Prayer to help Me gather and unite all souls.</p>
<p><b>Crusade Prayer (128) To gather and unite all souls:</b></p>
<p><i>Dearest Jesus, help us, Your beloved disciples, to gather the world in Your Arms and present to You the souls who are in most need of Your Great Mercy.</i></p>
<p><i>Empower us with the Gift of the Holy Spirit to ensure that the Flame of Truth engulfs all those who have become separated from You.</i></p>
<p><i>Unite all sinners so that each is given every chance of reconciliation.</i></p>
<p><i>Give all of us the strength to remain firm to Your Holy Word when we are forced to reject the Truth, which has been proclaimed to the world through the Most Holy Gospels.</i></p>
<p><i>We remain in You, with You and for You, every single step of this, our journey to salvation. Amen</i>.</p>
<p><strong>Be at peace. Trust in Me. Leave all your prayers at My Feet and I will respond to every single request made of Me to save any soul whose name is presented to Me.</strong></p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
