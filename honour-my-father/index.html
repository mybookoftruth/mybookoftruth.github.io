		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, I have missed the time you promised Me yesterday. I realise that you lead a very busy life, but remember that I Am the Life Whom you must seek out above all your day-to-day activities.</p>
<p><b>Time for man to honestly reflect on his life</b><br>
The time for mankind to reflect on his life, in a truly honest way, has come. All My children everywhere, in every corner of the world, must ask themselves this question. Do they or do they not believe that God the Father, exists? As the end times foretold draw nearer and nearer, a number of choices will now have to be made. Do you, My children, accept that God, My Eternal Father, created you? If you do, then answer the next question. How much time do you spend thanking Him for the Gifts of life, your family and friends? The home you live in? The food you eat? If you don’t, you are not a follower of the Truth.</p>
<p><b>Show My Father respect</b><br>
For those of you who do believe in God the Creator of all things, do you not know that prayer is vital if you are to benefit from the next glorious life He has planned for you? Speak to Him daily. Show Him the respect He deserves, because by not paying attention to Him, you offend Me. For all those devoted followers of Mine, I, your Divine Saviour, Jesus Christ, call on you now to understand how important it is to honour My Father. He is not being given the attention He deserves. Many people have this image of God the Father, as being stern, frightening and angry. So in awe are you that you push Him to one side. If you knew how much He craves your love you would drop down on your knees this instant and beg Him to forgive you. Please pray to God the Father. He needs your love. He needs your devotion. Prayer to My Father yields tremendous Mercy. When you ask My Father to protect you and to save you, in My Name, He rarely refuses your request according to His Most Holy Will. God, My Eternal Father is very Loving, Compassionate and allegiance to Him will bring the world great graces and salvation.</p>
<p><b>Pray to My Father to avert global disasters</b><br>
Pray to My Father to avert global disasters on behalf of His beloved Son and He will hear your prayers. So very few Christians in the world especially call on Him for help anymore. He, Who so lovingly created man in His Image, has been forgotten about. Show Him the honour that is now required, to help alleviate the ecological catastrophes that will occur on Earth during the Great Tribulation.</p>
<p>My Father holds the world in His Hands. His children, however, no longer honour or adore Him. They are oblivious to the fact that while Satan continues to steal souls there is only one Power that will withstand eternity and that is the Power of God. In His Mercy He will hear your cries for help. Please call on Him now, especially in these times of great change.</p>
<p>Your beloved Saviour<br>
The Son of God the Father Almighty<br>
Jesus
