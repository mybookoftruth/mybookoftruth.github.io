		<p>My dearest daughter, <strong>My Protection is extended right now over all of My children in the world who love Me. I do this in abundance, because of the threats facing humanity during this time in history. </strong></p>
<p><strong>You, My children, must pray for every one of those who are lost to Me.</strong> I pine for them. I crave their love. I weep for them. I wait for the day when they will understand My Covenant, created by Me in the beginning. For this is the final period – the final chapter in the fulfillment of My Holy Will. It was by My Covenant that I gave man the time needed to come to his senses and to recognise himself for what he is and what he is not. Man was created by My loving Hand, in My Own Image. I flooded his soul with My Love, I gave him complete freedom, through My Gift of free will and free choice. I never wanted man to reciprocate his love out of fear for Me. I only wanted him to love Me, just as I loved him. I created My Angels before man, to serve Me, but because of My Love for them, they too, were given the Gift of free will.</p>
<p>It was because of the betrayal of Lucifer that man suffered. He, Lucifer, was loved and favoured by Me. He was bequeathed with extraordinary gifts and powers and many Angels served under him. When I created man, Lucifer went into a jealous rage. He could not bear that I would love My children to such a great extent and so he set out to separate Me from My children. He tempted Adam and Eve and this meant that they, by their own free will, denied My Power and thought – just as Lucifer did – that they could attain My Power and claim a piece of My Divinity.</p>
<p>Lucifer, along with his loyal angels – all of whom committed atrocities against My children – then and now – were cast into the abyss for eternity. But because of their free will – given by Me freely and with Love to humanity, I never claimed it back. So<strong> I created the Covenant to win back their souls, through My Plans to redeem them.</strong> They received huge favours from Me. I sent prophets to warn them of the dangers of giving in to the temptation of the devil. I gave them the Ten Commandments to guide them and to help them live according to My Will. I<strong> sent them My only Son, taken from My Own Flesh, to bring them freedom from Hell.</strong> They would not accept this, but <strong>His death on the Cross was the turning point in My Plan of the Final Covenant. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Book of Truth is the last part of My Intervention, before the Final Day, when I bring all of My children together and back to the Paradise, which I created for them in the first place.</strong> Those who listen to the Truth and who remain true to My Holy Word, will find great favour with Me. Those who do not, will still find favour with Me, through the lives they lead, the love they show others and their purity of soul. I will welcome them, once they acknowledge that they accept the Hand of Mercy, which will be extended to them by My Son.</p>
<p><strong>The final stage of the fulfillment of My Covenant will be a painful one.</strong> Because of the influence of Satan and his demons, many people will be deceived into worshipping him and all his servants, who walk amongst you. I will tolerate the suffering of souls and the hardships, which will be borne by many innocent people, but only for a short time. Then, I will wipe My enemies off the face of the Earth. I promise you, dear children, that I will ease your pain, sorrow and fear, by bequeathing you powerful Graces and Blessings. You will be protected by the circle of My Hierarchy of Angels.</p>
<p>To ask Me to dissolve your fear and sorrow and to grant you the freedom from persecution, please recite this prayer.</p>
<p><b>Crusade Prayer (140) Protection of Hierarchy of Angels:</b></p>
<p><i>Dearest Father, God of all Creation, God the Most High, grant me Grace and Protection through Your Hierarchy of Angels. Enable me to focus on Your Love for each of Your children, no matter how they offend You. Help me to spread the news of the Final Covenant to prepare the world for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, without fear in my heart. Grant me Your special Graces and Blessings to rise above persecution, inflicted upon me by Satan, his demons and his agents on Earth. Never allow me to fear Your enemies. Give me the strength to love my enemies and those who persecute me in the Name of God. Amen.</i></p>
<p>Children, you must remain strong at this time. Never listen to the hatred and venom, which will cover the Earth, because of the infestation to come. When you ignore it, you can serve Me in the most beneficial manner, without any malice in your hearts.</p>
<p>Prepare for much anger is about to erupt in the world, which will be directed at Me, God the Most High and My beloved Son, Jesus Christ. Pray for those who will be sucked into a vacuum of lies, which will bring nothing but sorrow for them.</p>
<p>Remain in Me, with Me and for Me.</p>
<p>Your beloved Father</p>
<p>God the Most High</p>
