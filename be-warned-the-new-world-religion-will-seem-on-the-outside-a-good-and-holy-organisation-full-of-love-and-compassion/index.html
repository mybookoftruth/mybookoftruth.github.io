		<p>My dearly beloved daughter the great apostasy I spoke of is now gathering pace in the world.</p>
<p>This time it spreads like a veil over My Holy Church on earth and clouds its vision like a deep fog.</p>
<p><strong>This is the time for the great separation of My Church into two camps.</strong></p>
<p>On the one side you will have My beloved loyal sacred servants who follow My teachings and who never deviate from them.</p>
<p>On the other side there are those priests and other leaders in My Christian Churches who are influenced by modern life and who will desecrate My Laws.</p>
<p>They bow to the pressures from people who demand that they show tolerance in the name of God by changing God’s Laws to suit human demands.</p>
<p>They are full of pride, arrogance and worldly ambitions. Not to them will it matter if they change the Holy Sacraments to suit a sinful agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Now they will facilitate acts of abomination to be committed in My Father’s Churches and all in the name of civil rights and tolerance.</strong></p>
<p>They will condone sin and will insult Me by parading such sins in front of My Sacred Tabernacles expecting Me to swallow such vile acts.<br>
<strong><br>
Soon they will abolish the Sacraments to suit all</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In their place there will be held celebration parties and other forms of entertainment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This will become a New World church which will boast an impressive building in Rome but which will not honour God. </strong></p>
<p>It will be built with secret satanic symbols for all to see and it will idolise the beast.</p>
<p>Every sin, abhorrent to My beloved Father will be publicly honoured and millions of people will accept their laws of depravity as being worthy in the Eyes of God.</p>
<p>My sacred servants who remain loyal to me will have to hold secret Masses or face imprisonment.</p>
<p>They will gather in force and, filled with the Holy Spirit, they will continue to feed God’s children with the Food of Life.</p>
<p><strong>They must ensure that all those they lead are offered the protection of the Seal of the Living God.</strong></p>
<p>The time is very close now for the New Temple, to be built in honour of the Beast.</p>
<p><strong>This will be built under the dictatorship of the antichrist who will enter the world stage shortly as the man of peace.</strong></p>
<p>Gather together all My followers as soon as you can. My priests who recognise My Voice, you must begin your preparations to ensure that My Church on Earth can endure, with strength, the forthcoming persecution.</p>
<p>In time the refuges will be ready for you to use for I have been instructing My followers for some time to ensure that they will serve your purpose.</p>
<p><strong>This persecution will be short and you will get through it, painful though it will be.</strong></p>
<p>Be warned. The New World Religion will seem, on the outside a good and holy organisation full of love and compassion.</p>
<p>It will exude a magnificent image of tolerance and will extol every sin known to God. It will twist each sin so that it appears to become acceptable in the Eyes of God.</p>
<p>But you must know that such abomination sickens Me and woe to those who follow this dangerous path to eternal damnation.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p>Sin will always be sin in My Eyes.</p>
<p>Time does not change this. New rules, to suit man’s craving for sinful pursuits, will never be accepted by Me.</p>
<p>Prepare now for this great deception for it will take place very soon.</p>
<p>Your Jesus.</p>
