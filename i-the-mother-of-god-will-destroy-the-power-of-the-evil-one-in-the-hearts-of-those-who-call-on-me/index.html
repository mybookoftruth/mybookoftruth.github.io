		<p>My child, you must never listen to those who try to stop you in this Holy Mission. It is important that you remain in union with my beloved Son and know that those voices, who speak blasphemy against my Son, will continue to multiply. The hatred, which pours from their mouths, is not against you, but the Holy Word of my Son. Now, you know how many enemies my Son has in the world. <strong>The ones who hurt Him the most are those who say they love Him, but who reject Him now, as He speaks through the chosen prophets of God.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Those who use me, the Holy and Immaculate Mother of God, to hide behind, while they scream obscenities, fill me with tears of great sorrow. </strong>So hardened are their hearts and so filled with anger, that their hatred of these Messages will shock many. Those who believe that they defend the Word of God, and who reject those who come in His Name, must never condone those who show hatred to or slander others in His Name. When this happens and when those who claim to be prophets do this, know that these bitter attacks do not come from God, as this would be impossible.</p>
<p>I, the Mother of God, will destroy the power of the evil one, in the hearts of those who call on me. If they do not call on me, I cannot help them. I, as the Co-Redemptrix, could never deny the Truth, which my Son wishes to reveal to the world. My duty is to my Son. I would never tell you to reject or denounce the evil one and then deceive you by claiming to be the Mother of God.</p>
<p><strong>Those who claim to honour me through my Most Holy Rosary and then say wicked things about my Son, by declaring His Messages to be lies, insult my Son and dishonor me.</strong> My Most Holy Rosary, when said slowly and from the heart, will open your hearts to the Truth of this Mission. You must never give up hope, even if you are not given the Gift of discernment. It will be given to you, if you ask me to consecrate your soul into the care of my Son. If this is done with a simple and humble spirit, my Son will reward you with the Gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Children, you must never insult my Son’s prophets, even if you do not believe them. You must remain silent and pray for them. Should you reject my Son’s prophets, He will not hold this against you. But, if you declare that His Holy Word, given to the true prophets, to be that of the evil one, you will suffer terribly.</p>
<p>Remain calm, children, and place your trust completely in my Son. Surrender yourself into His Mercy and He will guide you and peace will be yours. Go, my dear children, safe in the knowledge that my Son loves you. <strong>He forgives all souls, for all sins, with the exception of eternal sin – blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
