		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, not one man amongst you is so clean of soul that he can judge others in My Name. But know this, those of you who are loyal to Me and who follow My Teachings – you will have to bear much sorrow when you have to witness the greatest evil abomination, which faces the world.</p>
<p><strong>In the name of social justice and social compassion, the false prophet will set out, what the world will believe to be, to evangelise and create a modern church. This church will be seen to reach out to all sinners and to embrace those sinners whose sins are not acceptable by Me.</strong></p>
<p>You, My beloved followers, will be viewed as a heretic sect, because you will continue to proclaim the Truth. All attempts to remain true to Me will be attacked vigorously. You will be outcast and declared to be right-wing dissidents. Any attempt to retain the traditions of the Sacred Ceremonies will be ignored.</p>
<p>The power of those who will mislead My churches on Earth must not be underestimated, as millions of sacred servants will embrace the new false doctrine. They will, mistakenly, believe that this new doctrine is a form of evangelism. Their support, as willing servants of the abomination, will make it very difficult for those Christians who know the Truth. Their voices will be like whispers amidst the screams of those who will become slaves to lies, created in My Name.</p>
<p>Know that the pain of rejection will be exactly as I, and My apostles, had to suffer during My Time on Earth. The priests of the day, who claimed to love God, had no hesitation in silencing the voices of My disciples, who brought them the news of Who I was. This time, as I herald My Second Coming, My prophets and My disciples will find it harrowing when their voices will be dismissed and they will be accused of blasphemy.</p>
<p>While My followers expand and grow, they will be like paupers and they will climb the Hill of Calvary – naked, with nothing except their faith. While they will keep the Flame of My Light alive in My Church – My True Church – they will never deviate from the Truth and they will carry on their backs a heavy cross. This is the cross of salvation, for on their poor, weary backs they will carry the sins of those who deserted Me. Their lot will be hard. Because of their love for Me, they will suffer because of others, in order to save their sorry souls.</p>
<p><strong>These souls do not deserve to be saved. They will only be saved because I choose to save them. They will have insulted Me, caused terrible suffering to My loyal followers and tormented My Remnant Army. Yet, I will save them because of the faith of those in My Remnant Army.</strong></p>
<p>Those other people, who have sold their souls to the beast, know this. You may not believe in Hell, but I will reveal to you what suffering it will bring you. <strong>The day I will show you the levels of torture in Hell, it will terrorise you and many of you will scream for My Mercy. And I will save you, if you ask Me to forgive you. I will do this during the Day of the Great Warning.</strong> Those of you, who witness the burning fires of Hell, but who will not turn to Me – you will not survive The Warning and that moment when you reject Me will be your last.</p>
<p>All those, who remain loyal to Me and true to My Word – though you will suffer – the future ahead of you is one of great glory.</p>
<p>Those who will not heed My Warning or listen to the Truth will be in great danger.</p>
<p>Those of you, who idolise the beast and who follow the false prophet into the new world religion, will be thrown in the burning fires of Hell, alive, with these two.</p>
<p>The Truth is bitter to taste, but when you accept it, it will bring you Eternal Life, where you will enjoy My Kingdom forever with your loved ones. Do not cut off the umbilical cord to Eternal Life, for you will suffer such terrible suffering and you will never be given a reprieve.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
