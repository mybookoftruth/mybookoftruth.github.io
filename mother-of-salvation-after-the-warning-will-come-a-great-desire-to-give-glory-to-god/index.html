		<p>My children, you will always be under my protection when you call on me, the Mother of Salvation, throughout this Mission. <strong>I am a servant of God and my role is to serve my Son, Jesus Christ, and help Him in His quest for souls, which will cover the whole Earth. Not one nation will be excluded by Him. </strong>My Son’s Plans, to prepare the world, include every race, nation, creed and every man, woman and child will be aware that He is coming to help them. He does this because of the deep Love, which God holds in His Heart for His children. </p>
<p><strong>Many people, who do not practice any religion, will be unable to ignore the Intervention in the world by my Son, Jesus Christ. They will be overcome and unable to comprehend, at first, the extraordinary spiritual experience they will feel, in every fibre of their hearts and souls.</strong> What a joy The Warning will be for many people, as it will bring with it the proof of my Son’s Existence. With this Gift, many will be filled with a peace they will have never felt before, as well as a great longing to be in the company of Jesus.</p>
<p>While all doubts about the Existence of my Son will flee from the minds of those who are blind to the Truth of the Word of God – for many, they will need spiritual direction once the Truth of The Warning is revealed. After The Warning will come a great desire to give glory to God. This will be a period of great trials; because the enemies of God will do everything possible to convince the world that The Warning – the Illumination of Conscience – did not take place.</p>
<p>When God humbles Himself to call out to His children and when He begs them to listen to Him, this is one of the greatest Acts of Generosity on His part. <strong>Children, accept The Warning with good Grace, because for many it will be the lifeline they need to live in the world without end.</strong> Never reject great acts or miracles from Heaven, for they are for the good of all, so that salvation is granted to the masses and not just the few.</p>
<p>Always give thanks for my Son’s Great Mercy. <strong>You have heard how Generous He is and soon you will bear witness to the extent of His Mercy, which will encompass the world. </strong></p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation<b> </b></p>
