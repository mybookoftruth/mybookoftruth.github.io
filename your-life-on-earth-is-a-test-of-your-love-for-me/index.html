		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, it is only natural for people to fear the unknown and this is why they fear death. Death is one of the most frightening things  in the minds of man for many are blind to My Promise of Eternal Life. Were they to witness My Glorious Kingdom then death would have no power over them.</p>
<p>I welcome all souls into My Kingdom. I do not reserve a place only for the holy and the elect, although there is a special place in My Kingdom for them. I welcome all sinners, including those who have committed terrible sins, for I Am first most a God of Great Love. I will welcome anyone who calls out to Me in reconciliation and remorse. Once this happens, before the point of death,  every soul will be greeted by Me and I will embrace them.</p>
<p><strong>The only barrier between a man’s soul and My Kingdom is the sin of pride. The proud man, while he may be ashamed of his sin, will always strive to justify it in some way. I say to him now. Two wrongs do not make an evil act right. The proud man will waste too much time pondering on whether or not he needs to be redeemed by Me. But death can come in but just an instant  and when it is least expected. The man who is free from pride will fall down before Me and beg Me to forgive him and he will be exalted</strong>.</p>
<p>Do not fear death, for it is a door which leads to My Kingdom. All I ask is that you prepare for that day by living life as I have taught you. I do not ask you to stop every daily responsibility. You have a duty to others; you must never feel that you must isolate yourselves from your loved ones when you follow Me.  I desire that you love your families and your friends and give them the time they need to ensure that love is expressed openly to one another. Love everyone as I love you. You do this in the way you treat people; the time you spend living in harmony with others; what you say about them to others and how you help those who cannot help themselves.  Your life on earth is a test of your love for Me. You show your love for Me by  the love you show for others, including those who curse you.</p>
<p>It is important, always, to speak with Me daily, even if it is just for a few minutes. It is during this time that I Bless you.   Please, never allow fear of the new world to come to encourage you to desert those who are close to you. You must focus on Me, and when you do this you will find peace. You must then take this Gift of peace to your loved ones.  Know, though, that you will suffer because of your love for Me and you will experience hatred from others. To rise above this hatred you must respond only with love. Always.</p>
<p><strong>I bring you freedom from the bonds of death and it will have no hold over you. Because of  My Resurrection you will become whole again, in perfect body and soul, in My New Kingdom . What is there to fear if I bring you this Gift of Eternal Life?</strong></p>

<p>Your beloved Jesus</p>
