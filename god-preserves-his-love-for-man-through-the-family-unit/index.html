		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, My Heart belongs to all families and it is My Desire to bless every family, small, medium or large at this time. When love is present within families, this means that God’s Power is upheld, for all His children belong to Him. It was He Who created every single one of them.</p>
<p><strong>God preserves His Love for man through the family unit because it is within such circumstances that His Love naturally thrive</strong>s. The love contained within families who are united yields great Graces because, the love of family members for one another is one of the greatest Gifts from God. God uses the love in the family to spread its wings, so that each member of a loving family will help to spread this love, wherever they go. Likewise, when the family unit breaks down, this will have a direct impact on your community, your society and upon your nations.</p>
<p><strong>When God created Adam and Eve, He desired a family of His Own, upon which He lavished everything. He will always strive to protect families because this is the place where love is first discovered by mortal man.</strong> When love thrives in families so, too, will it thrive in those  nations. Because the love for one another evolves from the family, it is precisely for this reason, that it is attacked by Satan. <strong>Satan will use every influence he can to infest people so that they will justify every reason to break up the family unit. He will prevent families from being formed and he will try to stop it from re-uniting should that be the Will of God.</strong></p>
<p>The family, borne out of the Love of God, will always be attacked by evil. To protect your family from the evil one please recite this Crusade Prayer.</p>
<p><strong><em>Crusade Prayer (167) Protect my family</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong><em>O God, my Eternal Father, through the Grace of Your beloved Son, Jesus Christ, please protect my family, at all times, from evil.</em></p>
<p><em>Give us the strength to rise above evil intent and to remain unified in our love for You and one another. </em></p>
<p><em>Sustain us through every trial and suffering we may endure and keep alive the love we have for each other so that we are in union with Jesus.</em></p>
<p><em>Bless our families and give us the Gift of Love, even in times of strife.</em></p>
<p><em>Strengthen our love, so that we may share the joy of our family with others so that Your Love may be shared with the whole world. Amen.</em></p>
<p>Remember that God created each one of you in His Likeness so that He could create the perfect family. Be thankful for your families for it is one of the greatest Gifts He has bestowed upon the human race. When the suffering on this earth comes to an end, and when hatred is obliterated, God will unite humanity as one in Him. You will become whole again and His Family will have Eternal Life.</p>

<p>Your Jesus</p>
