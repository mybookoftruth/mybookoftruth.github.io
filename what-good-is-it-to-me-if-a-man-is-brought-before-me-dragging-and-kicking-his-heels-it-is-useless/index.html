		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, it is important to extend the love any of you has for your family, outside of your home.<strong> I urge all of you to view those you know, those you don’t, your enemies, as well as those close to you, just as you would if they were your natural siblings.</strong> So many people have forgotten how to love others, just as I have loved you. It is not easy to love strangers, but I say to you – be kind to others and show them respect, even if they reject you. Above all you must show them charity. You must care for the needs of others, as if I have sent you to care for them directly.</p>
<p>When I gave you My Word, it was My Desire that all souls be saved. In order to be saved, you must not be selfish and attend only to your own souls. <strong>You, My beloved followers, have a duty to share the Gifts I bring you now, through these Messages, to others.</strong> Share My Love with others and especially your enemies. Pray for all those who need My Intervention. Treat them with patience. <strong>When you give them My Gifts, My Prayers and the Seal of the Living God Protection, then you must withdraw and allow them time to turn to Me. </strong></p>
<p>I do not instruct you to force people to accept the Book of Truth. By their free will it will be their own choice as to whether or not they wish to listen to Me. Assure those people that every Intervention will be made by Me, Jesus Christ, to win over their souls. The weakest amongst them will respond, in some way, to My Call. Those who have hatred in their souls for Me will find, at some stage, a softening of their hearts and they will not understand why this is. So you must always bring Me souls, through love and patience.</p>
<p>What good is it to Me if a man is brought before Me dragging and kicking his heels? It is useless. <strong>The Crusade Prayers, which I have given the world, are so powerful, that through God’s Love the souls of all those for whom you pray will be shown great Love, Compassion and Mercy by Me.</strong> All you have to do is to give them the Prayers and then ask Me to draw these souls to Myself. For I never reject the sinner who is in most need of My Mercy.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
