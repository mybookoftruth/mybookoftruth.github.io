		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, as I continue to cleanse the world with My Gift of the Holy Spirit, greater hatred for Me, Jesus Christ, ensues.</p>
<p>As My Presence increases within the hearts of man, the amount of hatred will be seen through the actions of those who contradict My Most Holy Word.</p>
<p><strong>Those who continue to bring in laws, which blaspheme against God, will increase every effort to defile the Word of God.</strong> These vile acts must come to pass, as the Earth is being purified. As the cleansing intensifies, so too will the evil of sin be exposed to you. You will notice that every conceivable act, which is against God, will be promoted by those enemies of Mine. Many will profess their innocence, but these acts will not be accepted by those of Mine, who know the Truth. The Gift of discernment, which I bequeath to many souls, means that these evil acts perpetrated by those in positions of power, who control nations, will be seen for what they are – the work of Satan.</p>
<p><strong>Satan’s evil spirits have increased their presence in the souls of those who do not believe in God.</strong> Not content are they that such souls turn their backs on God, these wicked spirits goad these people into promoting the most vile sins. In time, these souls become so corrupt and full of hatred for God, that they will plunge into a darkness, which will never be able to tolerate the Light of God.</p>
<p>Remember, My Mercy is great. <strong>It will only be by My Mercy that these people can be saved.</strong> There is no other hope for them, for many of these tortured souls are not capable, by their own free will – so infested are they – of asking for My Hand of Mercy. <strong>Those of you who know Me and who love Me must help these poor people by begging for the salvation of their souls.</strong>  You must ask that they turn to Me now, so that I can intervene to stop the persecution they intend to inflict upon the world. You must beg Me, through personal sacrifice, that they are stopped from the genocide they are planning. The worst form of genocide will be seen through unjust wars and the murder of the innocent in their mothers’ wombs.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
