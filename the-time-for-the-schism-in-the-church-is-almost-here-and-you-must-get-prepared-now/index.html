		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, I wish to embrace all of My disciples and followers everywhere in My Arms at this moment.</p>
<p>I need your comfort, children.</p>
<p>I need your consolation in My suffering, as I cry tears for My Church on Earth.</p>
<p>So far removed have some of My sacred servants become, that many do not believe in My Second Coming.</p>
<p>Those priests, bishops and cardinals who do believe are being pushed aside and forced to keep silent.</p>
<p>How I weep for these poor, precious disciples of Mine who have pledged their lives to Me and to the spreading of My Teachings to humanity.</p>
<p>Soon they will have to watch what they say about My Holy Word, for they will be forced to proclaim the teachings of a liar, whose soul does not come from the Light.</p>
<p>Unite, My children, My beloved priests and all those who love Me, now and help Me to save souls.</p>
<p>To do this you must not waste one moment. You must tell others of the Great Glory that lies ahead for each and every one of you at My Second Coming.</p>
<p>This Great and Glorious Event will be the moment when you will finally unite with Me, your precious Jesus, Who loves you all so much.</p>
<p>You, My beloved followers, must remain on your guard at all times.</p>
<p>You will be tempted to forsake Me, to denounce My True Teachings and be forced to honour and obey the wolf in sheep’s clothing.</p>
<p>So many poor souls will not only fall under the spell of the false pope – the false prophet, foretold so long ago – but he will have you believe that he has divine powers.</p>
<p>Children the time for the schism in the Church is almost here and you must get prepared now.</p>
<p>Join together as one.</p>
<p>Hold onto each other.</p>
<p>Protect each other and pray for those who will follow the wrong path and pay homage to the false prophet.</p>
<p>Much prayer is needed, but if you do as I tell you, you can save souls.</p>
<p>You, My precious followers, will form the Remnant Church on Earth and will be led by those brave sacred servants, who will recognise the false prophet for what he is.</p>
<p>Do not fear, as I Am bestowing Graces of wisdom, calm and discernment on each of you who ask Me to do so with this prayer:</p>
<p>O Jesus, help me to see the Truth of Your Holy Word, at all times, and remain loyal to Your Teachings, no matter how much I Am forced to reject You.</p>
<p>Stand up now and be brave, all of you, for I will never forsake you.</p>
<p>I will walk with you the thorny road and lead you safely to the Gates of the New Paradise.</p>
<p>All you have to do is trust in Me completely.</p>
<p>Your beloved Saviour</p>
<p>Jesus Christ</p>
