		<p>My child, when you work for my beloved Son, Jesus Christ, you must show obedience at all times.</p>
<p>Never question His Holy Word, because He <strong>speaks the Truth and only the Truth<strong>.</strong></strong></p>
<p>So many of my children question every Word He says, since the beginning. For every one who obeys His Holy Word, as contained in my Father’s Book, there is always another who interprets His Word, in a different way.</p>
<p>You must do everything that is asked of you under the direction of my Son. Never succumb to those who demand that His Words be adapted to their interpretation.</p>
<p>Move now, my child, with speed, to carry the Messages given to the world by my Son to save sinners who are lost. <strong>My Son has one intention and that is to save souls.</strong> Have no fear, my child, because everything my Son tells you does not contradict the Teachings of His Most Holy Church on Earth.</p>
<p>His Gifts to my children are very special and are being given in these, the end times, for all souls.</p>
<p>So generous and Merciful is my Son that He wants to shower sinners with special Graces, to ensure their salvation.</p>
<p><strong>Anyone, who tries to stop my Son in His Mission to prepare the world for His Second Coming, will be stopped by the Hand of my Eternal Father.</strong></p>
<p>This Work, to <strong>unveil the Book of Truth, as the Seals are broken</strong>, is one of the most important Missions on Earth for my Father.</p>
<p>The world has been promised the Truth, at this time.</p>
<p>All souls, believers and non-believers, must be told the Truth, because they are so far removed from the Church, that it must be given to them in this way.</p>
<p>All the angels have been sent to Earth to protect humanity against the deceiver, and the lies he spreads about the Truth of eternal salvation.</p>
<p>Mankind may not want to hear the Truth and many obstacles will be placed before you, my child, but it will be useless.</p>
<p><strong>No one will prevent the Book of Truth being revealed to the world</strong>, for should they attempt to do this, the Power of my Father will be unleashed, like <strong>Flames of Fire, poured from the Heavens</strong>. My child, never doubt these Messages as they are being given to you.</p>
<p>Never change one word to suit those who try to make you amend the Word of God.</p>
<p>There can be only one Master and that is God – in the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Go now with the assurances you need.</p>
<p>Remember these Messages, from my Son, are for all God’s children and are not just for His Catholic Church, or for His chosen people the Jews. They are for everyone.</p>
<p>Each soul is loved by my Father, equally. No soul is deemed more important than the other.</p>
<p>Your heavenly Mother</p>
<p>Mother of
