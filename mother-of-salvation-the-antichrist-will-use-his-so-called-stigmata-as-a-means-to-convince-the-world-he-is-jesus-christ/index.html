		<p>My child, when the deception engulfs souls under the influence of the antichrist, people will be fooled by many acts, deeds and words which will come from him. Sweet and soothing and with a calm demeanor, he will confidently justify every sin against God. Even the most vile sin against humanity will be gently explained away as if it is of no consequence. He will convince many that the taking of life is for the good of others and an important part of human rights. Blasphemies, which will pour from his mouth, will be seen as just and proper. He will justify everything by quoting Holy Scripture, backwards. Those who will hang on to his every word will not know enough about the Word of God to be able to contradict him. Then he will give the impression that he prays constantly and will declare that he is spiritually gifted.</p>
<p>The antichrist will seek out the company of those who are seen to do great works of charity and he will court those who are seen to be holy in God’s Eyes.</p>
<p>In time, people will convert to what they will believe to be a truly enlightened one-world religion, in which the antichrist will play a large part. Then<strong> he will use every demonic power, given to him by Satan, to convince the world that he has the stigmata, associated with the saints.</strong> The antichrist will use his so-called stigmata as a means to convince the world he is Jesus Christ and that he has come to salvage the world. Then <strong>he will say that he is announcing the Second Coming and those who fall at his feet, in adoration, will be swept away with him by the Angel of the Lord, who will throw them into the lake of fire. </strong></p>
<p>Your Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
