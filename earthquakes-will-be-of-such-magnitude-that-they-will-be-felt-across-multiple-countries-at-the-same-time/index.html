		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, <strong>when the time comes for Me to make Myself known, at My Second Coming, you will not recognise the world, for it will have changed so much. </strong></p>
<p>The speed at which humanity will fall into the depths of sin will shock you. Every ugly sin of the flesh will be visible and many will have to watch these sins committed in public places. Very little shame will be shown by the culprits who, like lions in a feeding frenzy, will sink to the lowest depths of depravity, not seen since the days of Sodom and Gomorrah. Such will the infestation of humanity be, brought about by the evil one, that murders will be committed everywhere and suicide will be rampant. As Satan devours souls, he will ensure that every Law laid down by My Father will be broken. Cold hearts, barren souls and obsession with false gods and evil spirits, will replace the love, which still exists at this time in the world.</p>
<p>My Name will be used to mouth obscenities and they will curse one another in their hearts. My daughter, <strong>the Truth can be unbearable at times, but justice will be handed down, by My Father, upon those lands which desecrate His Word.</strong> <strong>All the punishments handed down by My Father will take place before My Second Coming.</strong> Cities will disappear, countries will be awash with the tides of My Father’s Anger and earthquakes will be of such magnitude, that they will be felt across multiple countries, at the same time.</p>
<p>My daughter, you have already been given the information about those cities, which will suffer greatly. You must offer Me your tears, in atonements for the sins of those whose fate lies in darkness. Without your suffering, I cannot do what is needed to save these souls. So please, be generous with your pain and I will show Mercy, for those whom you place before Me.</p>
<p><strong>Mountains will sink, lakes will merge with the seas and lands will be reduced by one third. Rainfall, which matches My Tears of Sorrow, because of the hatred in men’s hearts, will be constant, until My Tears are wiped away, through the reconciliation of sinners, who will be converted. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Know now, that Gifts given to the world by My Mother, over the centuries, must be used to protect yourselves. Know also, that the Medal of Salvation – more powerful than any other – will be your defense against the lure of the antichrist.</strong> Every attempt will be made to stop the Medal of Salvation, but nothing will stop the Powers associated with this Gift.</p>
<p>My beloved followers, you must focus on prayer in these days and place all your trust in Me, for those who are Mine will be protected and you will be My reason for showing Mercy to the afflicted and the heathen. You must never weaken or give up, because if you do, you will find this path towards Me impossible to navigate without My Light, which will be needed every step of the way, if you are to complete this journey.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
