		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, today you finally realised how much My Most Holy Word is not only opposed, but rejected, by certain members of My Church.</p>
<p>Those who are not fit to fall at My Feet and beg for Mercy, proclaim themselves fit to judge My Sacred Words, given to mankind to save their souls.</p>
<p>I Am a God full of Mercy, full of desire to save all of My children and Am slow to anger.</p>
<p>Today, My Patience was tested as another assault, this time from a man who professes to speak in My Name, was made to undermine these Messages.</p>
<p>You, My daughter, may not, from this day forth, engage with any such representative without first asking for My permission.</p>
<p>There is now a concerted effort being made to silence you, by a certain fragment within My Church.</p>
<p>My children, these are the times when the faith of My most ardent followers, including members of My Church, will be put to the test in ways not witnessed since My Crucifixion.</p>
<p>Just as I was viciously treated and condemned to death for daring to speak the Truth, when I came the first time, so too, will the same treatment be meted out to My prophets in the lead up to My Second Coming.</p>
<p>They will be sneered at, ridiculed and made to look foolish, when they spread My Word.</p>
<p>They will be accused of heresy, by those who proclaim My Teachings, but who fail to recognise My Word given to the world today.</p>
<p>Be fearful, those of you who attempt to block the pathway I now lay down before you, in order to save humanity.</p>
<p>You will be punished.</p>
<p>You will have to answer to Me for the injustice you inflict on those sent to proclaim the Word of God in these, the end times.</p>
<p>Reject the prophets of the Lord and you reject the Word of the Lord.</p>
<p>Your arrogance blinds you to the Truth and you do not have the right to represent Me.</p>
<p>You offend Me greatly and your rejection of My Holy Word wounds Me deeply.</p>
<p>I weep at your cruel rejection of Me, while at the same time, you preach a watered-down version of the Truth of My Teachings.</p>
<p>You must spend time now in Eucharistic Adoration before you can communicate with Me, to enable Me to guide you on the path of discernment.</p>
<p>Examine your reasons for rejecting My Words.</p>
<p>Is it because you do not want to hear the Truth of the schism, which is to grip the Catholic Church?</p>
<p>Is it because you do not accept that the Church has been infested by the deceiver?</p>
<p>Don’t you understand that this has all been foretold?</p>
<p>You must pray so that you will see the Truth and come to Me for guidance, before it is too late.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
<p>Redeemer of all Mankind</p>
