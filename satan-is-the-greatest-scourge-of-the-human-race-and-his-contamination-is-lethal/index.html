		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, <strong>the man who does not believe in evil does not believe in sin.</strong> <strong>He who declares that evil is in the mind of the beholder is capable of accepting evil in every guise and will, eventually, become immune to it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When evil is ignored, Satan has won a great victory, for the king of lies goes to great lengths to disguise evil and he usually does this by presenting the argument to promote tolerance in society.</strong> When human intelligence is used to argue all the rational reasons for excusing evil, these souls, guilty of spreading such untruths, become prime targets of the evil one.</p>
<p>Once a soul allows him in, the great deceiver will convince his prey that they are acting in good faith and for the good of the world, when they justify wicked acts, which are against God. The evil one has created such deceit that many people, who no longer believe in Satan or the evil which he has spread throughout the world, will become incapable of distinguishing the difference between what is right and what is wrong. These people will argue and present every rational viewpoint to promote immorality in all aspects. Then the man who dares to defend morality will be demonized by them. Such is the way of humanity in the world today. <strong>When the existence of evil is rejected, then the existence of Satan is denied.</strong> This is when the king of lies and every enemy of Mine gains strength and his willing victims, who will act as his mouthpieces, become immune to Divine Graces.</p>
<p>When Satan is rejected by My Church on Earth, then very little can be done for those who are truly infested by the evil one. <strong>When My Church denies the existence of the beast or the eternal abyss into which he and all the fallen angels have been thrown, then you will know that the Truth is not being revealed to God’s children. </strong></p>
<p>If people do not know of the dangers that Satan inflicts upon souls, then they will not be able to arm themselves against evil. When this happens, the True Teachings of God are no longer accepted for what they are.</p>
<p>Time does not change in My Kingdom. Satan is the greatest scourge of the human race and his contamination is lethal.<strong> So careful to hide himself, he is a master of deceit because he will always present good as evil and evil as good.</strong> Only those whose eyes are truly opened to God will understand the threat he poses in the salvation of the world.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
