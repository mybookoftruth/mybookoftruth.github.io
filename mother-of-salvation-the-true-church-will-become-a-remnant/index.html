		<p>My dearest child, <strong>the greatest deception, which will descend upon humanity, will come from within my Son’s Church on Earth </strong>and it will be instigated by His enemies, who have infiltrated it by devious means. Satan will enter my Son’s Church and the signs will be clearly seen by those who have the Spirit of God firmly implanted in their souls.</p>
<p>The faith of my Son’s holy servants will be shattered, as many will feel compelled to desert Him through acts of sacrilege. <strong>Many poor unfortunate servants will be asked to swear allegiance to a new oath and they will be too frightened to walk away, </strong>although many will know, deep within their hearts, that it will be wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Many new rules will be introduced into my Son’s Church on Earth, as thousands of newcomers will be sworn into the Church and they will not be authentic, for they will not have the True Spirit of Christ within their hearts.</strong> They will enter the Church and will bear witness to a new one world religion, which will not honour my Son, Jesus Christ.<strong> Not only will they not serve Him, their duty will be to serve the needs of humanism, which will, at its very core, deny the Existence of the Supernatural State of God and all that He stands for. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The clergy, who once pledged their lives to God, will be drawn into this great deceit</strong> and as a consequence will lose the True Faith. They will not promote the importance of the salvation of souls, which was made possible by my Son’s death on the Cross. The Cross is at the centre of Christianity. There is only one Cross and it will be through the Cross that the first visible signs of the betrayal of my Son will be seen. New kinds of crosses will be introduced which will snub the Sign of the Cross and what it means in the hearts of man.</p>
<p><strong>Non-believers, who up to now, had no interest in Christianity, will be drawn into the so-called new one world church.</strong> Along with all other religions, which do not spring from the Truth, they will scoff and sneer at the children of God, who will remain true to the Word of God.</p>
<p><strong>The True Church will become a Remnant and this Army will unite throughout the world</strong> to become the latter-day saints and they will be empowered by the Holy Spirit in order to sustain the Truth. They will be spat at; laughed at and accused of being radicals, just as my Son, Jesus Christ, was accused of heresy when He walked the Earth to preach the Truth.</p>
<p>It will require tremendous courage to stay true to the Word of God, for you will be accused of wrongdoing. Your crime they, the enemies of God, will say is that you spread untruths about this abomination. <strong>Everything, which comes from God, will be declared to be a lie</strong>, while the truth, which they will say is represented by the new one world religion, will be a lie.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit will, however, cover those who continue to spread the Holy Gospels and my Son will cover you and protect you. <strong>The future of the survival of the human race and the right to the Eternal Life, promised to every man, woman and child, will rest on your shoulders.</strong> It will be the Remnant, which will keep the Light of God aglow in a world, which will be plunged into darkness.</p>
<p>Many of you will be challenged and lies planted within your hearts, by the spirit of evil, to turn you away from the Truth. Sadly, many of you will find it too difficult to remain true to your convictions and you will be tempted to turn your backs on my Son.</p>
<p>To ensure that you remain strong, courageous, calm and at peace, as you take up the Cross of my Son on your shoulders, you must recite this Crusade Prayer. For many of you who find it difficult to accept that these things are to come,<strong> there will come a day when you will recite this, Crusade Prayer (158) three times a day</strong>, because the pressures, which will be placed upon you to deny my Son, will be overwhelming.</p>
<p><b>Crusade Prayer (158) Protect me from the one world religion:</b></p>
<p><em>Dear Jesus, protect me from the evil of the new one world religion, which does not come from You. Sustain me on my journey to freedom, along the path to Your Holy Kingdom.</em></p>
<p><i>Keep me in union with You, whenever I am tormented and forced to swallow lies, which are spread by Your enemies to destroy souls.</i></p>
<p><i>Help me to withstand persecution, to remain firm to the True Word of God against false doctrines and other sacrileges, which I may be forced to accept.</i></p>
<p><i>Through the gift of my free will, take me into the Domain of Your Kingdom, to enable me to stand up and proclaim the Truth, when it will be declared to be a lie. </i></p>
<p><i>Never let me falter, hesitate or run away in fear, in the face of persecution. Help me to remain firm and steadfast to the Truth for as long as I live. Amen.</i></p>
<p>Go, my dear children, and accept that these things will happen, but know that if you remain loyal to my Son, you will help to save those souls who will be plunged into error.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
