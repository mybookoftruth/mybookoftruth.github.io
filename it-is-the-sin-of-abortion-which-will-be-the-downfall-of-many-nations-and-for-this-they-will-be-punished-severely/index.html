		<p>My dearly beloved daughter the apostasy in the world has God’s children confused about the existence of sin.</p>
<p>Many souls, when they think of Sin, instantly think of the most grevious of sins such as murder.</p>
<p>Sin takes many forms.  Sadly because sin has been dismissed as  faults or traits it is now deemed to  be simply a natural weakness. Many no longer believe in sin.</p>
<p>Abortion, after murder of one’s brother, is the greatest form of genocide in the world. Yet it is not only tolerated but laws are brought in by your nations which deem it a necessity.</p>
<p>It is the sin of abortion which will be the downfall of many nations and for this they will be punished severely.</p>
<p>Abortion is a despicable act and it wipes out generations of God’s children who cannot defend themselves.</p>
<p><strong>No one will kill a child of God and avoid severe punishment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The anger of My Father will be witnessed by those nations, who have legalised abortion, during the Chastisement.</strong></p>
<p><strong>They will be wiped out and no compassion shown to them just as they showed no remorse for this mortal sin when they condoned the killing of God’s children in the womb.</strong></p>
<p>I call out to those who cunningly try to dismiss abortion as something which is needed to protect the rights of a mother.</p>
<p>Lies are used to camouflage the atrocity of abortion which defies the Law of God.</p>
<p>For this sin, any lawmaker, doctor or any person who contributes in any way to this abominable act, is guilty in the eyes of God and will suffer the punishment which lies ahead.</p>
<p><strong>To those who condone execution I say this.</strong></p>
<p>You, who condemn a man to be killed, are guilty of the same crime he may be guilty of.</p>
<p>You are guilty of murder in this instance and it is a mortal sin.  You have not been given the right to take a life. Or to judge. Only I, Jesus Christ, have the right to judge.</p>
<p>Anyone who contributes to the death of a murderer, through the act of execution will suffer in the fire of Hell for eternity, unless they repent.</p>
<p>So many of you believe in the law, an eye for an eye. How misguided you are.  Do you not accept My Father’s Commandments? Thou shalt not kill.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not kill also applies to those aggressive armies who march into lands which do not belong to them, in order to control.</p>
<p><strong>It applies to armies who shoot and kill innocent souls. All of this is murder. It is against the law of My Father.</strong></p>
<p>Other sins such as greed, lust, speaking ill of others, cheating people out of what is rightfully theirs, revenge and slander all lead to all other sins.</p>
<p><strong>They become acceptable in your world today because your greatest love is for yourselves.</strong></p>
<p>The lie, which you have been forced to swallow by your false teachers, self-gratification, is your path to sin.</p>
<p>You are told that you must spend your time satisfying  your hunger for wealth.</p>
<p>You are told that you must look after yourself – that you are the most important person in your life. You must seek out everything to satisfy all your senses. Everyone else comes second.</p>
<p>This leads to greed, selfishness, lust and then you can be enticed to commit mortal sin.</p>
<p>Sin will now be accepted by your nations like never before.</p>
<p>Laws will be introduced which will legalise mortal sin and woe to those of you who object.</p>
<p>Those who will advocate  such wickedness will tell you that these laws are to protect the vulnerable when, in fact, all they do is to legalise murder, abortion, same-sex marriage and the idolatry of false gods.</p>
<p>They will condone the persecution of the poor and cast them out onto the streets to make paupers out of them.</p>
<p>They will bring in laws to force you to stop practising your religion. By doing so you will be breaking the law – a sin in their eyes.</p>
<p>As I told you before your world is so full of untruths that good is presented as evil and evil presented as good.</p>
<p><strong>Your world is back to front and, as a result, sin flourishes.</strong></p>
<p>I urge you to go back and study the Ten Commandments. Obey them and live as you are expected to in the eyes of My Father.</p>
<p><strong>Break the Commandments and you sin. Argue that certain sins are okay and you defy My Father</strong>.</p>
<p>Obedience to the Laws of God is weak and fragile in the world at this time. Many of God’s children have not been told firmly, by My sacred servants, of the consequences of sin.</p>
<p>Tolerance of sin is the greatest sin of all.</p>
<p>Tolerance is a cunning lie planted in the minds of humanity by the king of lies, Satan.</p>
<p>Tolerance is another way of justifying sin to suit man’s weakness for succumbing to the temptation of Satan.</p>
<p>Wake up and accept sin for what it is.</p>
<p>Argue amongst each other and defend sin all you like but it will never be acceptable in the eyes of My Father.</p>
<p>To enter Paradise you must be free from sin.</p>
<p>To become free from sin you must repent.</p>
<p>To repent you must first of all accept the Ten Commandments.</p>
<p>Then you must show true remorse.</p>
<p>True remorse can only be felt by those who humble themselves before Me.</p>
<p>Only then can sin be forgiven.</p>
<p>Only then are souls fit to enter My Father’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>Your Saviour<br>
