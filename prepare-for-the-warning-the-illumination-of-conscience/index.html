		<p>Tonight, My dearly beloved daughter, you were given the graces to make you stronger to continue with this sacred Work. Through the devotion of My beloved and cherished followers, who have been praying hard for you, you, My daughter, will forge rapidly ahead to complete the Book of Truth. No matter how much you are distracted, you still find it hard to reject your duty to Me. This is pleasing to Me but we don’t have much time.</p>
<p>The world, My daughter, is being given this special Gift – the Book of Truth – to show My children what they now need to do in order to prepare for The Warning, the Illumination of Conscience, which is being given to mankind to help prepare them adequately for My Second Coming.</p>
<p>For those who don’t believe in Me they must still be given the chance to read the Truth. When this event takes place, after these Messages are given to the world, people will understand the authenticity of My Words given through you, My daughter, to save mankind.</p>
<p><b>Mystical Event to be experienced by all over 7 years of age</b><br>
Don’t feel hurt when people dismiss these Messages, My daughter. Just be thankful that they are being given this Gift. They will understand the Truth of this prophecy, when after this Mystical Event, which will be experienced by all of My children over seven years of age, everywhere throughout the world, takes place. Those who live after this event will be more cautious about the contents of this sacred Book. They will find it difficult to ignore, even if their faith is weak; others who don’t want to know the Truth still need to be reminded of the contents of this Work.</p>
<p>Never give up, My child, when it comes to saving souls. All My precious children were born out of the Love of My Eternal Father. When they lost their way it did not matter. God, My Eternal Father still loves each and every one of His children.</p>
<p>Faith, My child, can be rekindled by the faith of others blessed with the Holy Spirit. My chosen children, sent to spread My Word now, to the world, have the ability to bring tears of joy into those poor souls screaming out for direction in their empty confusing lives.</p>
<p><b>Look at everyone through My Eyes</b><br>
Always look on your friends, family, neighbours and work colleagues through My Eyes. Always look for the good side. Show love to them and they will feel My Presence. They will be drawn to you and won’t know why.</p>
<p>Through My example, imitate Me and you will help Me convert My lost children. By praying hard for them you can draw them nearer to Me. Through sacrifice and the acceptance of suffering, in union with Me, you can save souls. This includes those souls yet to leave this Earth, as well as those awaiting Judgement in Purgatory.</p>
<p>Let Me remind you finally, that you have two choices. Believe in Me by opening your minds to the Truth contained in the Gospel. If you have lost all faith then read just a portion of My Teachings. Then ask Me to show you the Truth in your hearts. Then you will know which path will lead you to Me in Heaven. Alternatively, you can keep your eyes closed and refuse to listen. Only prayer, by believers can help you then. Prayer by My followers, combined with the recital of My Divine Chaplet of the Divine Mercy Gift, given to Sister Faustina in the 20th Century, can save your souls at the time of your death.</p>
<p><b>Pray the Divine Mercy</b><br>
Pray, pray, pray My <a href="/divine-mercy-chaplet/">Divine Mercy</a> for your own souls and those of non-believers, now. Prayer groups will help spread the Truth, instil faith in those who have lost all sense of who they are and where they came from. It will be instrumental in igniting the spread of evangelical enlightenment, which will now be felt in all parts of the world, as the time approaches for the prophecies in relation to My Second Coming on Earth begin to be revealed, as they unfold before a series of global events.</p>
<p>Be prepared, children, at all times. Keep in a state of grace and keep your hearts open to My Teachings of love and peace on Earth. If My children all followed My Teachings, then there would be no wars, greed, hatred or poverty in the world. You need to sit down quietly, every one of you, for just half-an-hour each day.</p>
<p>Go through the Psalms, the Parables and ask yourself, “Does this lesson apply to my life in today’s world?” You know the answer is, of course, yes. Pray for the strength to change your attitudes and views on life after death. Remember this important lesson. Earth is simply a brief passage in time. The only true happiness and eternal life is with Me in Heaven, Paradise – My Father’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>Your loving Saviour<br>
Jesus
