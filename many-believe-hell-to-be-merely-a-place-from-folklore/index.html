		<p><b> </b>My dearly beloved daughter, <strong>My Heart’s desire is to save those people, who commit terrible sin, from the torture of Hell.</strong></p>
<p><strong> For every mortal sin committed, the pain of fire will tear the soul apart as if it were made of flesh.</strong> The cries of anguish and terror, from such souls, as they are pulled into the depths of Hell, break My Sacred Heart.</p>
<p>My Heart is cut and the terrible pain I feel is because of these poor souls. <strong>Many people alive on earth, at this time, are in terrible danger.</strong> This, because so many believe that mortal sin is merely a minor fault and as a result, justify it. And, then, they continue on a path of self-destruction.  Unless they can see what grave errors they are making, they will suffer damnation, where they will burn in agony, for eternity.</p>
<p><strong>So few people believe in the existence of Hell.</strong> Many believe Hell to be, merely, a place from folklore. So many do not believe that God would allow such a place to exist, and that all sins, no matter how bad, are forgiven. I blame this on the errors made by those sacred servants, who, over the decades, succumbed to the pressures of a secular world. This deception has meant the loss of billions and billions of souls. And, while it is too late for these souls, there is still time for those who are marked with the stain of mortal sin, today, to be salvaged.</p>
<p><strong>You must pray that these people can be protected from the evil allure of Satan, who rejoices at the prospect of their fate.</strong> My Light will and can only be poured over them when they open their eyes to the truth of sin. Although they torment Me with their wickedness, there is not one among them who does not feel discomfort, or despair, because of their sins.  While many know the cause of such unrest, they will do nothing about it, as they continue to condone and justify their sins. Some do this because they are surrounded with the darkness of lies, which are embedded in their culture. Such lies promote the acceptance of sin.</p>
<p>Help Me to save them with this Litany</p>
<p><b>Jesus to Mankind Litany Prayer (5) For the Salvation of Those in Mortal Sin</b></p>
<p>“Jesus, save all sinners from the fires of Hell.</p>
<p>Forgive blackened souls.</p>
<p>Help them to see You.</p>
<p>Lift them out of darkness.</p>
<p>Open their eyes.</p>
<p>Open their hearts.</p>
<p>Show them the Truth.</p>
<p>Save them.</p>
<p>Help them to listen.</p>
<p>Rid them of pride, lust and envy.</p>
<p>Protect them from evil.</p>
<p>Hear their pleas for help.</p>
<p>Grasp their hands.</p>
<p>Pull them towards You.</p>
<p>Save them from the deception of Satan. Amen.”</p>
<p><strong> Help them, My followers, by asking Me, daily, to forgive them, for the terrible insults they fling upon Me.</strong></p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
