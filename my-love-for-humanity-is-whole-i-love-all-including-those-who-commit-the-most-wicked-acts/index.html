		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, look around you and what do you see? A world full of contradictions. On one side you will see love, joy and goodwill. But then this will be counteracted, on the other side, by the hatred, which the evil one has for humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Any unrest, sorrow, confusion, lack of trust, venom, hatred and evil which you see take place in the world; know that this can only come from one source.</strong> <strong>The scourge of humanity, that is Satan, has created desperate unhappiness amongst God’s children.</strong> <strong>Their pain then becomes Mine and this is why the evil one creates such havoc – to hurt Me.</strong></p>
<p>My daughter, everywhere you walk and every face you see, as and from this day, will be as I see them – each a child of God. How I love them all, how I want to cherish each of them – irrespective of their faults or their sins. It makes no difference what they have done to offend Me; I still love them – each and every one. I feel great joy when I see the love radiate from them – a love they have received as a Gift from My Father, Who created them. Their love is My Love and it draws other souls to them and this then spreads the Love of God everywhere.</p>
<p>But when I witness pain and suffering, in any soul, then their pain becomes Mine. Their pain can be caused by terrible suffering, brought about by lack of love for others, which brings a sense of desperate desolation. Their loneliness and isolation is felt by Me also and this ignites My Compassion further.</p>
<p>Then there are those souls who spend all their time chasing things, which do not come from Me. Those who reject Me, completely break My Heart in two. How I shed many Tears of Blood for these souls, for they have cut the umbilical cord, which joins them to their Saviour – their only hope of Salvation.  When you see these souls, My daughter, you will feel a terrible sorrow in your heart, just as I feel for them.</p>
<p>Finally, there are those who say that they represent Me, but who are not worthy to wipe My Feet. Their hatred of Me is caused by their love for themselves. Yet, no matter how often they insult Me and mislead My flock, I still crave their souls.</p>
<p>My Love for humanity is whole. I love all, including those who commit the most wicked acts. So it will be until the end. I will embrace all souls until the last day, when after all efforts by Me to save souls have been exhausted, only those who run into the abyss of the beast and who refuse Me, despite knowing how much I love them – will be lost to Me, forever.</p>
<p><strong>Always love each other, faults and all – the way I love you.</strong> When you disapprove of someone, remember My Love and remain silent. When you despise another know that this hatred does not come from Me. When you look at one another, see them as if through My Eyes. Not one of them should be shunned by you. Instead, show compassion to those who displease you, offend you or cause you harm, for they are loved by Me. If you love Me, you will show love to all of those with whom you come into contact.</p>
<p><strong>Love is infectious because it comes from God. Only good can come from love.</strong></p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
