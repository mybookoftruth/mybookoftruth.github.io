		<p>My daughter, those followers of Mine, who are well-read in matters of Holy Scripture, tend to get carried away with their own human interpretation, so that the lesson I have preached to love one another is so easily forgotten. Love one another. Honour your mother and father. Honour your Creator, God the Father, and live as I have told you in love and fear of My Father.</p>
<p>So many learned men, caught up in their analysis of My Teachings, forget one thing. That is, when I will come again to Judge. Never for one moment do they consider that this time may well happen in their own lifetime and not in the distant future. Why then do they search and continue to search for further meanings in Holy Scripture when the Truth is so simple? Why do they not remember that love is all I ask? Love for Me, your Saviour. Love for God the Father and love for each other.</p>
<p>For those intellectual experts who proclaim to be able to analyse My Teachings and then go as far as attempting to predict a date for when I will come again, I say this. If you try to assume that you have been able to discern the year for My return, then you are sadly mistaken. No one will be given this date, not even the angels in Heaven or My beloved Mother. But this I can reveal. The Tribulation started some time ago. The Great Tribulation will begin at the end of 2012. This terrible period is being mitigated through the prayers of My dearly beloved followers. It will also be diluted through the conversion achieved after The Warning takes place. This event is good news, My children. It is to help eradicate the slavery by man to the evil one.</p>
<p><b>Religious experts display an arrogance, which I find repulsive</b><br>
Many, sadly, will ignore My pleas to prepare, so caught up are they in this so-called intellectual religious debate, based on human reasoning, one trying to outdo the other to prove that he or she is more knowledgeable. These experts display an arrogance, which I find repulsive. They are no better than the Pharisees were. Their ignorance blocks out the Truth when it is presented before their very eyes.</p>
<p><b>My Word is being ignored by My sacred servants </b><br>
My Word has fallen on deaf ears. My Word is ignored by My sacred servants, as I attempt to communicate with them at this point in history. Yet, after The Warning there will be no excuse for them not to sit up and listen to My instructions. For then they will hold out their arms pleading with Me to guide them through the Great Chastisement. For when this prophecy is unveiled to those who doubt My Word, through this messenger, I urge you then to take up My Sacred Cup, drink from it and fight to save souls.</p>
<p>I urge all of you, including those self-proclaimed scriptural experts, to sit down in humility and ask this question. Why would I encourage simple believers to become embroiled in an argument over My return to Earth? All that matters now is that I Am coming. Be prepared at all times. Never judge others in My Name. Seek out the gift of humility at all costs for it will be your passport to Heaven.</p>
<p>Your beloved Saviour</p>
<p>Jesus
