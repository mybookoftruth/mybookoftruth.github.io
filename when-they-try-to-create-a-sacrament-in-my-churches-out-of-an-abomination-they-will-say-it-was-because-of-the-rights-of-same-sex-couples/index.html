		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, the visions I allowed you to be shown, of souls plunging into Hell, was not to frighten you. Instead, it was to show you the reality. In this way you will now understand how I suffer, every day, as I watch souls plunge into the depths of Hell.</p>
<p>Oh if people only knew the terror of Hell, and the way in which the beast devours such souls, they would avoid sin at all costs.</p>
<p>Those same souls can still be saved, My daughter, through the prayer of the Grace of Immunity. By doing so, you, My disciples, will bring Me relief from this terrible heartbreaking scourge.</p>
<p>Those, who die in mortal sin, are destined for the fires of Hell. Many commit these sins, in the belief that if there really is a God, then, He is merciful.  And so, they continue to sin, until they justify their sins, so that they become, eventually, in their eyes, to be of no consequence.</p>
<p>They will say that they had no choice because their sin was necessary in order to benefit others.</p>
<p>With the sin of murder, they will say it was to avenge the death of another.</p>
<p>With the sin of prostitution, they will say it was to help their family put food on the table.</p>
<p>With the sin of abortion, they will say that it was to benefit the life of the mother and to make her life easier. In the case of sexual deviation, they will say that it was just a natural thing.</p>
<p>In the case of those who participate in the practices of the occult, they will say that it is harmless fun, yet they honour the beast when they do this.</p>
<p>When they persecute others and destroy not only their name, but their livelihoods, they will say that this was a necessary punishment, for the sins of others.</p>
<p>When they destroy another person in mind, body and soul through dictatorship, they will say it was for their own good.</p>
<p>When they try to create a Sacrament in My Churches, out of an abomination, they will say it was because of the rights of same sex couples who have the same rights as others.</p>
<p>When they destroy My Church, from within, they will say that all churches are equal. They will use the excuse that there is only one God, so they can introduce a pagan church.</p>
<p>These sinners are the lost souls I speak of.</p>
<p>To help them, you must first of all look into their eyes. Think of them as your children or your brothers or sisters. See them through the Eyes of God. Then you will feel love. But terror will fill you, because you know in your heart, the terror, which will face them. How you must pray that they will see the Truth, soon.</p>
<p>How you must pray for the salvation of these souls.</p>
<p>Every child of God, including those whose souls are black, is loved.</p>
<p>Their sins must be destroyed, before all God’s children can unite, as one family, in My New Kingdom.</p>
<p>You, My daughter, have been given all the graces and the ammunition to destroy sin and to save, not only your own soul, but, the souls of others.</p>
<p>Thank you, My daughter, for having responded to My Call.</p>
<p>You have much work to do.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
