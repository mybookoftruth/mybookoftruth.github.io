		<p>My dear children the Gift of Discernment comes from the Power of the Holy Spirit and it is not given easily. It must be earned. It is only given to those who are in union with Christ and who are free of all distractions of the temptations placed before them by the evil one. The evil one cannot deceive those who are blessed with this Gift.</p>
<p>Woe to the man who is deceived for he will allow himself to be led into falsities. Deceit comes from Satan himself and those he infests. Anyone who does not accept the Existence of Jesus Christ will find it almost impossible to withstand the smoke of Satan, which blinds each and every one of you who are guilty of allowing the sin of pride to devour you. Any sacred servant of God who wanders away from the Truth will lead all those, who look to him for guidance, into error. For this he will suffer a great punishment on the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p><strong>The influence of the secular world is akin to that of a great flood and souls who allow it to change their view or opinion of the word of God will drown. Deceit is a tool of the evil one and his main focus is to destroy my Son’s Church on earth by seducing those within it. Open your eyes to new changes, which will be introduced and which curse the Name of God.</strong></p>
<p>You must never allow falsities to influence what my Son taught you for my Son never deviated from His Written Word, nor will he ever do so. The Truth will sustain you during the trials which lie ahead, and which will scourge my Son’s Church on earth. You must prepare for these times for they are almost upon you.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
