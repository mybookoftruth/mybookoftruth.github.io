		<p>My dearest daughter, the time for Me to send My only Son, Jesus Christ, back, to gather all of My children into My Heart, is close.</p>
<p><strong>My Heart, the fountain of all Life, will open to gather all of My children as one.</strong></p>
<p>My Promise, to salvage all of my little ones, is almost complete.<br>
</p>
<p>My greatest desire is to reveal Myself to every single person, including those who do not understand why or how they were created by My Hand.</p>
<p><strong>Soon, My Son will be sent to unveil the Truth of the Creation of humanity.</strong></p>
<p>This day has been prepared for so many decades. It could not have taken place, up to now, for the loss of so many of My children, would have been too great.</p>
<p>Soon, My children will be shown the Truth of their creation, their existence, and the immortality of their souls.</p>
<p>While this event will create great hope and  joy in many souls, for others, it will be a torment, which they will not be able to bear.</p>
<p>My Fountain of Love and Mercy is to be showered upon the whole of humanity through My Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>After this will come the great divide, when the souls who respond to His Mercy will be taken aside.</strong></p>
<p>The remaining souls will be given every opportunity to hear My Call from Heaven.</p>
<p>I, their Father, will make Myself known by the power of the climates. My Hand will be witnessed as I reach out to each of My children, to save them from death.</p>
<p>My Call will be heard, but not by all. Those souls will be shown My Love, through My prophets, in a last attempt to draw them into My Heart.</p>
<p>The skies will unfold and be pulled back. Like a scroll, they will roll over, until the signs of the Heavens are revealed. The sounds of My Angels will entice these poor little souls of Mine, until the very end.</p>
<p>I now pledge that My Fountain of Love will cover the whole earth, as I unite My Heart with the hearts of all of My children.</p>
<p>My Divine Intervention will be witnessed by billions and many will run into My Sacred Arms in relief. The Truth of My Divine Plan, and the mystery of life on earth, will be laid bare for all to see. Only then will man accept the Truth of the existence of Eternal Life.</p>
<p>The end of suffering on earth is near. The final persecution, where the evil one reigns over My children, is completed.</p>
<p>Then, the freedom I  have yearned for, My children, since the beginning, will  be theirs at last.</p>
<p>Look to Me, children, your beloved Father, for I hold you in My Hands. I am coming, through My Son, to take  you into My New Kingdom on earth.</p>
<p>This is the legacy I have promised My Son. This is My promise to all of My children.</p>
<p>The time, for these great miracles, is drawing very close.</p>
<p>I bless each and every one of My children.<br>
I love you.<br>
I cover you and unite you to My Heart.<br>
Your Father<br>
God the Most High</p>
