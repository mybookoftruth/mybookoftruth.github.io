		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, do not be under any illusion, the deceiver has turned your head away from Me for the last few days. You put this down to the fact that you were busy, but this is not quite true. So cunning is he that he deliberately interrupted every single minute of your time. During this time you were aware that you were not devoting time to Me. Isn’t this so? You felt distracted and lost and then you realised that you were empty inside without Me. Close by you the entire time, I nevertheless, allowed you to feel abandoned by Me. For now you have experienced the despair felt by souls whom I reject, because of sin. All of this is important for your spiritual development. While it may seem pointless that I allow this, it is part of your training towards the holiness that I require and demand of you. You, My precious daughter, will continue to feel a form of abandonment, from time to time, as will many souls who are on this same path.</p>
<p>The stairway to spiritual perfection is a very long one. Souls will take one, two and more steps backwards, for every single step they take towards Me. I ask you, My daughter, to tell all My followers to prepare carefully for this stairway, which is essential before the top step is reached. In My Message of November 24<sup>th</sup>, 2010, when I first told you about this stairway, I explained how some people climb these steps much too quickly. But you know that would be a mistake. Be aware that it is I Who guides you along the steps the entire time.</p>
<p>Children of Mine, you must now climb every step of the spiritual stairway before you reach the top steps to the door of Paradise. Be patient. Do not be disappointed when you fall. Simply stand up again and begin climbing all the way.</p>
<p>Children, I will hold you by the hand and take you to the top if you allow Me.</p>
<p>Your beloved Saviour<br>
Jesus
