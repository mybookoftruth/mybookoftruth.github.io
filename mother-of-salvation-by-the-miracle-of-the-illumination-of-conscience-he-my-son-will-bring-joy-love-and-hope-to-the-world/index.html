		<p>My child,<strong> please let it be known that my precious Son is preparing for His Great Intervention of Mercy.</strong> The world will be renewed as a result and many will rejoice in their new-to-be found freedom from doubt about the Existence of God.</p>
<p>How lonely are those who do not know my Son. When my Son stood on the mount, just before His Ascension into Heaven, His disciples were confused and frightened because of the separation they would have to face without Him. Many of them panicked and begged my Son not to leave them. He comforted them by patiently explaining to them that this separation would only be temporary and that He would send them help. The help He was referring to was the Gift of the Holy Spirit. Then He said to them: “Do not fear, for by the help of He Who I will send to you, you will not be alone. I will always be with you in the Form of the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p>For, although He told everyone that day that He would come again, they did not truly understand what He meant. Some thought that it would be weeks before He would make Himself known. But, remember, a day in God’s Time, can be any time. <strong>Now that Day is drawing close and all the prophecies foretold, as to the signs of the time of the end, are happening.</strong> <strong>Have no fear in your hearts, dear children, for the time for rejoicing is almost upon you. There will be no more tears or sadness, for my Son’s Great Day will dawn suddenly and He will gather all of His own into His Sacred Arms.</strong></p>
<p>Pray for God’s Great Blessings and for the Great Mercy, which my Son holds, in great abundance, for each one of God’s children. This includes the good, the bad and the indifferent. <strong>By the miracle of the Illumination of Conscience, He, my Son, will bring joy, love and hope to the world.</strong></p>
<p>Be thankful for this great Mercy. My Son’s Love for you will never die, fade or be withheld, because you belong to Him. You are His. You are the children of God. You do not belong to Satan.</p>
<p><strong>Pray, pray, pray that humanity will choose the Merciful Hand of my Son over the deceit and the wicked stranglehold, which the evil one exerts over the weak.</strong></p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
