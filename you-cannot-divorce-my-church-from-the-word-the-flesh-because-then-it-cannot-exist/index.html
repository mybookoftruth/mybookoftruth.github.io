		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, to those who accuse you, through My Holy Word, of fighting against the Authority of My Church, they must hear My Call.</p>
<p>The Church, created by Me, Jesus Christ, was built upon a firm Rock and no matter how much My Church – My Body – is attacked, the gates of Hell will never destroy It. <strong>Satan and his agents will only attack what is genuine, what is True and what is of Me.</strong> This is where all his energy will be focused on – My Church. I Am Present in My Church, through My Body, the Most Holy Eucharist. <strong>My enemies will always target the Most Holy Eucharist, as It is not merely a symbol of My Love, My Promise to redeem the world – It is My Body.</strong> It lives and breathes, for It is I, Jesus Christ, Who dwells in It. I will remain Present within the Holy Eucharist until close to the end, but My Church will never die.</p>
<p>My Word was made Flesh and through My Flesh, you, God’s children, will remain close to Me. When My enemies attacked My Church in the past, My Church united and fought against Its opponents. But when My Church is attacked, by the spirit of evil from within, It will face very few obstacles from a secular world.</p>
<p><strong>Satan does not attack his own work.</strong> As the Son of man, I will never desert My Church, for It is impenetrable against the devil. My followers will remain true to My Church up to the last day. However, <strong>the number of people who will not understand the attacks, which My Church will come under, from within, will be high. They will, for the most part, be content with the many adaptations to be introduced in the Holy Sacraments and the Laws of God.</strong> <strong>They will swallow the lie that modern life calls for a modern church; that people today need to be able to make choices, based on their own free will – irrespective as to whether or not they insult God.</strong> Then when they insult God and commit blasphemy, when they desecrate the Holy Eucharist, they will no longer be part of My Church. My Church will remain intact. My Church will stay standing, because of those who will remain true to the Word of God – the Word, which became Flesh. For you cannot divorce My Church from the Word – the Flesh – because then It cannot Exist.</p>
<p>I promised that I would protect My Church against the gates of Hell and I do this now by preparing My loyal sacred servants to stand by Me and to remain true and steadfast until the Great Day. I never break My Promise.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
