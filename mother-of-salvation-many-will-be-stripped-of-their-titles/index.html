		<p>My dear children, please pray for my Son’s loyal sacred servants as future events take place. Many will be stripped of their titles and sent out into the wilderness, in disgrace. Turmoil and confusion will spread within my Son’s Church but the traitors will rise in great numbers and many will follow them. Other Christian Churches will become close to the newly adapted church, and then all will be set in place for a new global religion to rise up.  This new form of church will, at first, seem to be a breath of fresh air for many who desire change. Then, it will become clear that it serves only those who want the Laws of God, changed in order to suit their sinful lives. This church will lose the entire Faith. It will have all the appearances of a new, renewed church of God but any symbols, which are meant to glorify my Son, will be nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>Then, as the time becomes ripe, <strong>the new one world church will be announced and it will be seen as a great humanitarian institution. It will be intrinsically linked to the world of politics and business.</strong> Then those who never belonged to any creed will join it. How they will rejoice, because every sin will be excused and so many people will be relieved, because they will be able to live their lives as they choose. No longer will they have to worry about offending God, because they will not regard sin as something to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>The new church, in order to exude a sense of worthiness, will promote humanitarian works and charities and the whole world will applaud it. Soon afterwards, there will be no distinction made between it and global political alliances and business organisations, dedicated to philanthropy. </strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, my Son’s true Church, as it was built by Him, will remain alive but weakened. Small in numbers, the remnant church, will never give up even when the Antichrist takes over.</p>
<p>Pray, pray, pray that my Son’s sacred servants will overcome their fear and stand up to proclaim the Truth, even when their voices are drowned out by those who betray my Son.</p>

<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
