		<p>My dearly beloved daughter My Love for you is as strong, as it is as intimate, although it does not seem like to this to you at this time.</p>
<p>You need to spend more time in My Company for only by doing this will you find peace in this mission.</p>
<p>My Graces fill your soul now so that you can communicate to the world My messages in the fastest time possible.</p>
<p>How weary I am and alone in My Heart right now My daughter.</p>
<p><strong>I fret for those innocent souls who are ignorant of My existence. Good at heart and Christian in the way they treat others, yet, they do not believe in My existence.</strong></p>
<p>I watch each day at the way they live their daily lives with no faith in the existence of God or their future life in the New Paradise.</p>
<p>Please help Me to tell them I love them.</p>
<p>Spread My Word and I will ignite a sense of recognition in their souls.</p>
<p>It does not matter if they reject you, My daughter, or My beloved followers; all that is needed is to let them read My messages.</p>
<p>I will send the Holy Spirit so that a spark, albeit a tiny one, will ignite a flame of My Love in their souls.</p>
<p><strong>This is My last mission on earth where Holy Messages from the Blessed Trinity are being given to the world.</strong></p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is present in these Words of Divine origin. They are your food to nourish your souls in order to help you prepare for battle.</p>
<p>Listen to the Holy Word of God. Take it, share it and unite all of God’s children ready for battle.</p>
<p>Bring all of your brothers and sisters, especially those who struggle to believe in God, towards My Great Mercy.</p>
<p>My Heart heaves with love for them. They, each of them, are God’s children.</p>
<p>I need their souls so that I can take care of their future so they will have eternal life and happiness.</p>
<p><strong>I can’t bear to think of what will happen to them if I can’t save them.</strong></p>
<p>My daughter, while My Divine Mercy will save much of humanity, I need you and My followers, My sacred servants and ordinary people to spread the net and find all those poor, unhappy and confused people in need of God’s Love.</p>
<p>Spread the net of My Love, like the fisherman, wide and far and in places where God is completely rejected, despised and  hated especially.</p>
<p>Then go and find God’s precious young children who do not know anything about Christianity, yet they live in so called Christian countries.</p>
<p><strong>Go as far as Russia, China and countries where God is not revered and go and capture souls</strong>.</p>
<p>Feed them with My messages. It does not matter how you communicate but do it in a way where it does not seem as if you are preaching.</p>
<p>Entice them through what may interest them. Use every kind of modern communications to do this. I need them quickly. I am relying on the spreading of My Word by all of My followers.</p>
<p>I will guide you.</p>
<p>You will know in your hearts what to do. Ask me to help you with this special Crusade Prayer to make you strong.</p>
<p><strong>Crusade Prayer (72) The Disciple’s Prayer</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Dear Jesus I am ready to spread your Holy Word.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Give me the courage, the strength and the knowledge to impart</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>the Truth so that as many souls can be brought to You.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Take me into your Sacred Heart and cover me with your Precious Blood</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>so that I am filled with the graces to spread conversion for the salvation of all of God’s children in every part of the world no matter what their creed is.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I trust in you always.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Your beloved disciple. Amen<br>
</em></strong></p>

<p>Your Jesus</p>
