		<p>My child, it is important my children do not lose courage when faced with the hurt they will have to face, as my Son’s Church will be cast into the wilderness of the desert.</p>
<p>I am the Woman in the Book of Revelation, clothed with the sun, who gave birth to the Child. The Child is Jesus. The Mystical Body of my Son, Jesus, is His Church on Earth. My Son’s Church is being stolen and soon His Body will no longer be present therein. This desolation will tear the hearts of those, who follow the Teachings of my Son, in two. Those, who will have nowhere to turn, will find themselves cast out of the buildings which have, up to now, housed the Holy Eucharist. But, while they will have been thrown out, with little mercy shown to them, they will be filled with the Holy Spirit. This means that they will be guided and will lead fiercely the Remnant Army, which is made up of those who are loyal to God.</p>
<p><strong>Others, blind to the Truth, will follow the false prophet into disarray. Their hearts will be deceived, and soon, when the false prophet will be seen to be at death’s door, they will sob. But then, just as if a miracle has taken place, the false prophet will seem to rise from the dead. They will say that he is blessed with great, supernatural powers from Heaven and they will fall flat on their faces before him in adoration.</strong> He will be loved and adored by those who cannot see.</p>
<p><strong>Soon the antichrist will appear and his rise to fame will start in Jerusalem. Once he appears in public, everything in my Son’s Church will change, quickly.</strong> The new rules will be introduced. New relics, changes in the garments worn by priests and many new regulations will be enforced. At first, people will say that all these changes stem from a need to be humble. And, while these abominations enter the Christian churches, the persecution will begin. Dare to object to these Satanic rituals and you will be deemed a heretic – a troublemaker.</p>
<p><strong>Many cardinals, bishops, priests, nuns and ordinary people will be excommunicated,</strong> if they do not follow the new rules or adore the false prophet. At this stage you must seek out refuges, which will have been created, so that you can worship my Son, Jesus Christ, in peace. Priests must continue to administer the Sacraments and provide my children with the Most Holy Eucharist.</p>
<p>You must never give in to the deceit, which you will be asked to take part in. Those who do will lose their souls to the evil one.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
