		<p>My dear children many people seek out my Son, Jesus Christ, in their lives, at some time. When a soul discovers my Son, it is a journey of different paths and of different stages that must be walked. When you become close to my Son it will be a struggle and so you must expect this. As you draw closer to Him, you will become more like Him and His Traits will become familiar to you. You may not meet my Son physically but you will get to know Him in every way. His Love you will feel. His Pain will become yours. His gentleness will be shared with you and the joy He experiences, because of His unconditional Love for humanity, will become yours. His Patience will be instilled in your soul and His Word will be ingrained within you and with an understanding, which will be given to you by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>When you truly love my Son you will become humble like Him and with a burning desire to serve Him, whatever the cost</strong>.  Some souls reach the spiritual path of perfection over time, but they will not complete this journey unless they hand over all their trust to God. If a soul falters along the way, he will be given the graces to pick himself up and continue on his journey. But if a soul competes with my Son, and considers himself worthy to challenge the Word made Flesh, then he will separate from God.</p>
<p>The person who finds Jesus in this life on earth and who serves Him faithfully will have peace. Little else in this world will ever satisfy him again. If a soul, having become intimate with my Son, then separates from Him, he will endure a terrible pain. <strong>Having known Him and lived within His Heart, this pain of separation from my Son is the worst pain known to man.</strong></p>
<p>When you are tempted to challenge the Teachings of Christ or when you are bullied into rejecting Him in any way, know that nothing of this world will ever bring you the peace, love or joy which comes from Him.<br>
Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
