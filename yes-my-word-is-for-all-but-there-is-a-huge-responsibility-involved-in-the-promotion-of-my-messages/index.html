		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, <strong>I give the world the Book of Truth for every soul, in every nation. It is a Gift for humanity</strong>, but know this.</p>
<p><strong>I give you, My daughter, the sole authority to decide how it is to be translated, distributed and published to protect this Work.</strong> <strong>Everything regarding the publication of these Messages can only be done under your personal approval.</strong> This is My desire and any man who does not obey My instructions to you, and publishes My Messages for profit does not have My Blessing.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, My Word is for all, but there is a huge responsibility involved in the promotion of My Messages and how the Book of Truth is published. Donations are not required, as the proceeds from the books must be used to fund the production of other books and the costs of publishing in all tongues.</strong></p>
<p>You, My daughter, will be constantly attacked for obeying Me in this matter. You will be accused of trying to profit from this Work, and yet you will know that this is untrue and not possible.</p>
<p>Those who will attack you most, in this matter, will be those who want to gain or profit in some way from My Word and they will become angry when you will not allow them to control this Work.</p>
<p><strong>I, therefore, declare that no one has been given the authority for spreading My Holy Word in book form – only you, My daughter. </strong>You may, however, give permission, under My Guidance, to those who ask to help you through websites and printed documents. But they may do this only when they seek and receive permission by you to do so.</p>
<p><strong>My Word is Sacred and all respect must be shown for My desires and instructions to humanity. </strong> You, My followers, must do as My prophet Maria asks of you and respect her wishes in relation to the publication of My Messages. Attack her, because of this Work, and you offend Me, your Jesus.</p>
<p>You will, My followers, be required to do My Holy Will at all times, no matter what the situation is.  <strong>I guide My daughter Maria. She has been chosen as the end time prophet. I speak through her. Her voice becomes Mine. Her sorrow and pain are Mine. Her love for others is My Love. Her joy comes from My Sacred Heart. Her hand is being guided by Mine. Her understanding as to how I wish My Word to be heard comes from Me.</strong></p>
<p>My daughter has been given these Gifts from Heaven for a reason. <strong>Listen to what she tells you, for you can be sure that it will have come from Me.</strong></p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
