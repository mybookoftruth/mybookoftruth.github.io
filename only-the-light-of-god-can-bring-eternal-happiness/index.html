		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, the beginning is without end. Once life is created by My Father and once man takes his first breath, he will exist in body and then in soul for eternity.</p>
<p><strong>The biggest mystery of Eternal Life is that it exists, whether or not man chooses.</strong> Man has been given the Gift of free will and up to the day of his last breath on Earth he has a choice. He can live his life, as best he can and according to the Laws of God, and earn his salvation, or he can squander the Truth of the Existence of God and live his life according to his own desires. When he satisfies his own lusts, greed and desires in contravention of the Word of God, he takes terrible risks, which will have consequences for eternity.</p>
<p><strong>Those fortunate to gain the most glorious salvation will live an Eternal Life of ecstasy in God’s Kingdom. He will enjoy every form of glory in union with the Will of God and he will live a perfect existence, which will never end.</strong> Those who chose to turn their backs on God, even when every effort will have been made by Me to save their sorry souls, will also have an eternal existence. Sadly, they will endure a terrible agony in lonely and desperate desolation. He too will be raised, along with the living and the dead, but his existence will be a painful one, as he will never see the Light of God. Only the Light of God can bring eternal happiness.</p>
<p><strong>When you take your last breath on Earth, this simply means that you are then taken into the next stage of your journey into eternity.</strong> <strong>There is only one path to take and that is the one where you come to Me.</strong> Any other path will lead you into a terrible existence and yet many misguided souls believe that they know the Truth when they reject the existence of eternity.</p>
<p>You must never reject the Truth for only the Truth can bring you eternal salvation.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
