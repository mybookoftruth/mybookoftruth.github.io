		<p>My dear children, you must prepare for my Son’s Plans to redeem you all in His Eyes. His Time for Intervention, to awaken the spirit within you, is drawing close.</p>
<p>Pray, pray, pray for all the lost children in the world who have severed all links to my Son, although they were weaned on the Truth. Soon, they will be in no doubt as to His Existence and you must pray that human pride will not come between them and God’s Mercy.  You must pray, especially, for those souls who have betrayed my Son,  in so many ways, that they are given the courage to humble themselves before Him and beg for Mercy.</p>
<p><b style="font-size:13px;">The Truth, dear children, given to humanity by the Manifestation of my Eternal Father, through His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, is being torn apart. Do not embrace any form of doctrine, which does not uphold the Truth as a whole. You must never say that part of the Truth is important and then deny the rest of it. You either accept the Word of God, laid down by Him, or you do not.  Time is of no significance. What was given thousands of years ago to man, through the Word of God, has not changed, nor can it. Anything, which comes from God must remain intact, no matter how difficult this is. To remain true to God’s Teachings requires great strength, stamina and a willful determination.</b></p>
<p>Love is the way in which you can remain true to my Son but this love must be unconditional. It must never be sullied by love for yourself because this does not give glory to God. If you truly love God,  you will remain loyal to the Word. If you say you are a disciple of my Son, Jesus Christ, then you must follow His Teachings, without condition. You must love one another as He loves you – without condition. You cannot say that you love God if you do not love one another. You cannot walk in His Footsteps if you do not forgive those who trespass against you.</p>
<p>It is only when you abide by the Laws of God that you will enter His Glorious Kingdom.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
