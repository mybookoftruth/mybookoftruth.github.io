		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, there are so many good and holy priests who have joined together to pull these Messages apart, but they do not have the qualifications or the knowledge to do so. Their path is to serve God. <strong>They must not allow themselves to be contaminated like this, because this poses danger for those souls who recognise My Voice in these Messages.</strong></p>
<p>While parading New Age practices of the spirit, many priests believe that their knowledge of spirituality means that they have the talent to recognise a true prophet of God. So far removed are they from Me, that they cannot discern My Holy Word. I have not given them such graces, because pride stands in their way.</p>
<p>To those of you, sacred servants of Mine, who plot, scheme and use the badge of your holy office in the service of God, as a means to turn your parishioners away from My Word, know that you will be punished. You do not truly know Me. You are not loyal to Me. You are ignorant of spiritual knowledge and you do not have the authority to publicly humiliate, pour scorn upon others or belittle anyone in My Name.</p>
<p>Each one of you will have to answer to Me. I will punish you, not for your disbelief, but for the sin of pride, which makes you believe that you know more about spiritual matters than I, Jesus Christ, Your Master. <strong>How you wound Me. How you disappoint Me, because your betrayal has hurt My Mission, the last of its kind. For every sinner you pull away from Me, you will have to take on responsibility for their souls.</strong> And then, with a heaviness of heart, you will have to answer these questions, when the Truth is made known to you.</p>
<p>Why did you reject My Cup when you were given the Truth, with love and trust, and when you knew in your heart that this was from Me? Why did you then try to destroy My Messages? Have you any idea as to the seriousness of the Holy vows you took in My Name? <strong>You must now go on retreat and read My Crusade Prayers.</strong> If you do this, then I will give you My blessing and the power of discernment. But only those with humble hearts can come to Me.</p>
<p>Go back. Then come to Me naked. Leave all your jaundiced views, your biased opinion and your assessment of these Messages, based on hearsay, gossip and innuendo, behind you. When that day comes, I will baptise you anew and you will become pure again. Your souls will become like little ones and with a craving hunger for My Presence.</p>
<p>I await your response. I Am all Loving. I Am all Merciful. Come to Me. I Am all you need.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
