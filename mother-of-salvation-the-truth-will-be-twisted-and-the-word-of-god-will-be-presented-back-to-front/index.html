		<p>My child, please encourage all of God’s children to persevere during the trials, which are to come. So many challenges will face all Christians, who will have to witness the wicked apostasy which will be paraded before them by those they will seek guidance from, in order to live whole Christian lives.</p>
<p><strong>Those who are to be appointed shortly, in the highest echelons of my Son’s Church on Earth, will not be from God. They will not serve my Son and will change many doctrines and laws within the Church. So quickly will they bring about such changes, with many new books, missals and letters being introduced, that you will know then that such works would have taken years to prepare.</strong> It would not be possible to introduce such radical changes in so many formats, were this not the case. This will be one of the first signs where you can be sure that this soon-to-be-introduced, twisted doctrine will have been created with great care.</p>
<p>Many people will not recognise these changes in the Church and those who do will applaud them, for they will assuage the guilt they will feel because of their sins. Finally, they will be relieved, for now it will mean that they will be able to openly proclaim their acceptance of all things which offend God. For, if the Church declares sin to be a natural thing and part of human nature, then this means, surely, that sin is no longer important. Then, by declaring the importance of looking after the world’s poor and hungry, they will deem themselves to be holy in God’s Eyes.</p>
<p><strong>When my Son is denied publicly and when His Word is twisted, great care will be put into great public acts of charity. This will divert attention away from the reality.</strong> It will create diversion and finally the True Word of God will no longer be discussed. When all religions are brought under one roof and where the views of the heathen are treated with great respect, then people will be afraid to stand up and declare the Truth. If and when they dare to do this, they will be accused of blasphemy.</p>
<p>The day is quickly approaching when to declare yourself a true Christian and when you remind people of the Word of God, then you will be accused of heresy. The Truth will be twisted and the Word of God will be presented back to front. Nothing will be orderly. Nothing will make sense in the new rules soon to be introduced into the Church of my Son. It is important that no matter how unpopular you may become, you must always remain true to the Word of God.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
