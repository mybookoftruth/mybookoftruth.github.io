		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, it is very difficult for souls, even those with great faith, to reconcile the world they live in with that of My Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>The world, as it stands, is incompatible with My Kingdom and this means that those of you who know Me and who truly love Me find it painful, at times, to live your daily lives.</strong> To love Me means following My Teachings and calling on Me to forgive you your sins. This is the only way you can become part of Who I Am.<strong> You cannot become part of My Kingdom until you acknowledge the Truth and accept that, while sin exists, the world can never be perfect.</strong> As long as man does everything according to his own free will, when he is being constantly tempted to indulge in his own selfish needs, he will remain a slave.</p>
<p>When you live life according to the Word of God, you will be able to see the world for what it is. You will witness the wonder that is the Miracle of the Earth, which was created by My Father. But, you will also see how the weakness of man has separated him from God. <strong>As long as this is the case, the world, as you know it, cannot be raised again, to its former Glory.</strong> This is why you will only find true peace when I come again to bring you into the Paradise My Father, created for you in the beginning.</p>
<p>The beginning and the end of the world will become as one. <strong>There will be no Heaven, no Purgatory and no Earth – there will only exist two entities. My Kingdom – where life will never end, for those who allow Me to gather them into My Heart and Hell for those who won’t turn to Me. </strong></p>
<p>All things will be according to My Mercy and the Holy Will of My Father, Who loves all of His children. He wants to save everyone and through Me. I cannot force those who do not want to be part of My Kingdom, or who reject all of My efforts to bring them a wonderful glorious eternity, to follow Me. Do not ignore My Pleas to help these poor souls.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
