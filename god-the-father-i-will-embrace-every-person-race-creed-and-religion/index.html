		<p>My dearest daughter, My Intervention to open the eyes of My children to the Love of My beloved Son, Jesus Christ, is drawing closer.</p>
<p>I love all of My children and I will call every man, woman and child over the age of seven years, into the Light of My Son’s Mercy. Prepare for My Intervention for it is sooner than you think and be thankful for this Great Gift. The spiritual warfare you are witnessing in the world is manifested on earth and the battle will arise between My enemies, who try to silence all those who refuse to be drawn into falsities, and those who do not betray My Son.</p>
<p>When the Hand of My Justice falls it will test the faith of all those who say they are for My Son, and only those who are willing to follow the Cross will remain strong enough to proclaim the Truth. Soon the cobwebs will be drawn back and the full extent of your inheritance will be made known to you. My Enemies will, for the most part, reject this Intervention and they will fight to the bitter end to deny Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I will embrace every person, race, creed and religion into the Light of My Son and many will see Him. As a result this will mean many will convert and ask for the right to live eternal life in the Glory of My Son’s Kingdom on earth.</p>
<p>I have promised that My Son will take up His Seat on His Throne and this will come to fruition. Those who do not want to become part of His Kingdom will make their choice based on the free will I have given to each of you.</p>
<p>I, your beloved Father, Creator of all that is and will be, beg that you do not squander your birthright. If you do, you will be devoured by Satan who is merciless as much as he is a liar, deceiver and accuser. You are  being given a Gift that no generation before you has been accorded and you must pray that you will be given the Graces to accept My Favour.</p>
<p>Come into the Light for if you do not then you will be blinded by darkness for eternity. This would tear My Heart in two and I do not desire to lose any of you.</p>
<p>I Bless you. I guide you through this Holy Mission, which is given to you by the Holy Blessed Trinity as foretold.</p>
<p>Your beloved Father</p>
<p>God the Most High</p>
