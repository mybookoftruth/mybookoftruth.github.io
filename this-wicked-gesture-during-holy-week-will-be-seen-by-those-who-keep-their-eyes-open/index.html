		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, what suffering is being experienced by My beloved sacred servants, close to My Heart, who know the Truth and who have to witness the abomination in My Church on earth.</p>
<p><b>There is to be a particular insult, which will be inflicted upon My Holy Name, in an effort to desecrate Me, during Holy Week.</b> This wicked gesture, during Holy Week, will be seen by those who keep their eyes open and this will be one of the signs by which you will know that the imposter, who sits on the throne in My Church on earth, does not come from Me.</p>
<p>My followers, you must know that the prophecies given to the world – warning of the time when the power, within My Church, will be seized by those who are loyal to the beast – are upon you. The time is now.</p>
<p><b>Remember that those who proudly display the badge of humility are guilty of pride.</b> Pride is a sin.</p>
<p>Those who say that My Church must renew its image, update My Church’s doctrine and who say that, by modernising it, that this will be accepted by more people, then know this.</p>
<p><b>Those of you who say that you follow My Teachings, but who want laws changed to condone acts, which are sinful in My Eyes, get out of My Church now.</b> You are not Mine. You have turned your backs on Me and are not worthy to enter My House. Yet, this is what will happen. You and all those of you who demand changes, which are embraced by the secular world, will be satisfied, for the false prophet will entice you into his favour and you will applaud every moment of his short lived reign. But, it will not be I, Jesus Christ, Who you will follow. You will be following a false doctrine, not of God.</p>
<p>So many will embrace the reign of the false prophet and push Me to one side with joy in their hearts. Then when the errors of his ways become apparent, My poor sacred servants will have nowhere to turn. Their sorrow will turn to fear and their fear will turn to despair. They won’t know who to trust, but they must understand this. <b>My Body, My Church, may be scourged and desecrated but My Spirit can never be touched, for It can never die.</b></p>
<p>To those of you who reject My Word now and the Truth you are being given, as a special Gift from Heaven, I bless you. I will continue to pour My graces over you until you come back to Me. I will never give up until I can save your sorry souls.</p>
<p><b>My Church, where My Teachings and Sacraments remain intact, will live and can never die. It does not need bricks and mortar to survive, for it is I, Jesus Christ, Whose Body is the Church.</b> You, My faithful beloved priests, sacred servants and followers are part of Me. You are united with My Body to form My Church on earth. So you must learn to be strong, courageous and faithful to My Holy Word, no matter what arguments are presented to you to the contrary.</p>
<p><b>The time for the schism to be laid bare is close, and already, a terrible unease is being felt in Rome.</b> When the Holy Spirit clashes with the spirit of evil, a line divides down the middle so that two sides emerge. The great divide will descend quickly. Then many of those who have been deceived by the liar will run back into My Sacred Arms for protection.</p>
<p>I guide you during these sorrowful times and ask that you all hand Me over your tears and I will comfort you in spirit.</p>
<p>I bless you. I bring you peace of heart. I protect you.</p>
<p>Your beloved Jesus</p>
