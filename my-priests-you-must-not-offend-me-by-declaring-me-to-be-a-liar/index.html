		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, I must explain that many of you who work hard to promote and spread My Holy Word will be attacked more than ever by self-appointed experts who will dismiss these Messages as being of no consequence.</p>
<p>Others, who attack you, will say that you have no right to proclaim My Word or to declare it to be the Truth.</p>
<p>Finally, you will be threatened by certain sacred servants from within My Church and told to stop what you are doing as they are offended by your work. They will say that these Messages are not from God.</p>
<p>They suspect that they come from an evil force. They will say that these Messages are in opposition to My Church’s Teachings. I say this to them.</p>
<p>What part of the Messages causes you such heartache? Why do you not speak the Truth when you criticise My Word?</p>
<p><strong>Why do you boast of your knowledge of spiritual matters which you say exceeds Mine?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you speak on behalf of My Body on earth, My Church? If so, then I have not, through My Holy Vicar, authorised this.</strong><br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p>Is your campaign to reject these Messages so intensely based on your own views and personal opinions?</p>
<p>You find fault and then threaten your flock that if they read My Word they will be misguided.</p>
<p>My Holy Word you say must be rejected and then you tell My followers that it is their duty to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you afraid of the King to Whom you have pledged your life?</strong></p>
<p>I am not to be feared yet, My Word, sits uncomfortably with you.</p>
<p>There are many self-appointed prophets in the world who are not authentic and need the prayers of many. For those who are authentic, however, they are the ones you will always target the most. It is My genuine prophets who incur the wrath of priests, who are still unsure of the objective of this My Holy Mission.</p>
<p>Be careful about whom you challenge, spread venom, untruths and create aspersions, for I have not given you or My Church the authority to do this. My priests, you must not offend Me by declaring Me to be a liar.</p>
<p>When the day of the Truth is revealed to you, you will feel much shame.</p>
<p>You must put down your weapons and eliminate all the hatred and anger which torments you right now. Then look at what has happened to you. Satan has deceived you in a way so that your verbal and written attacks on this Work goes way beyond that which is expected of you as a priest.</p>
<p>Why has this happened? It is to delay this Mission and to take people away from My Prayers, which have been sent from Heaven to save souls. What you are doing is trying to stop Me, your Jesus, in My Plan for the salvation of humanity.</p>
<p>This is a very serious offense against God.</p>
<p>Here is a Crusade Prayer to help you to respond to My Call and to release you from the torment of doubt.</p>
<p><strong>Crusade Prayer (86) Release me from the torment of doubt</strong></p>
<p>I come before you confused, unsure and frustrated, dear Jesus, because I am worried about the Truth You proclaim within Your Messages.<br>
Forgive me if I have wronged You.<br>
Forgive me if I cannot hear You.<br>
Open my eyes so that I can be shown what it is You need me to understand.<br>
I implore You, to give me the Power of the Holy Spirit to show me the Truth.<br>
I love You, dear Jesus, and I beg You to release me from the torment of doubt.<br>
Help me to respond to Your call.<br>
Forgive me if I have offended You and bring me closer to Your Heart.<br>
Guide me to Your New Kingdom and grant me the favour, so that through my own prayers and suffering, that I can help You to salvage souls so precious to Your Sacred Heart.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
