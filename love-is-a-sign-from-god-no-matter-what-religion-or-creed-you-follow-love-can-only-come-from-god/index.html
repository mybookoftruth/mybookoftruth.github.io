		<p>My dearly beloved daughter I wish to discuss the importance of love and how, without love, the world could not survive.</p>
<p><strong>God is love.  Love comes from God.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where you find love  you instantly feel the presence of God.</strong></p>
<p>Nearly everyone in the world feels love at some stage. Love frees the soul and its purity gives you a glimpse as to the depth of the love that God has for every single one of His children.</p>
<p>Love defeats death.</p>
<p>Love defeats evil.</p>
<p>Love is ever lasting.  It can never die for it comes from God and will last for eternity.</p>
<p>When love is attacked in this life by the evil one, who acts through souls, it suffers, withers and can be replaced by indifference or, at times, hatred.</p>
<p><strong>It is only through love, especially for each other, that peace in the world can evolve.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Without love people would die and become barren.</strong></p>
<p>When you love a child you are feeling the same kind of love that My Father holds in His Heart for each child born in the world through His creation.</p>
<p>Imagine a parent’s anguish when a child goes missing.</p>
<p>The grief, the worry and the anxiety are identical that felt by My Father when His children wander and become lost to the Truth of His existence.</p>
<p>Then imagine the horror which a parent has to endure if their child cannot be found.</p>
<p>What if they become lost forever? This is the heartbreak My Father endures when He loses His children.</p>
<p>Nothing consoles Him until He can find them again or when they turn and come running home to Him again.</p>
<p><strong>The whole of creation was founded through the love of My Father.</strong></p>
<p><strong>His Love floods the Heavens and the earth and is intensely powerful.</strong></p>
<p>All was created by His Divine Love and His generousity of heart so that he could share all the wonders of creation with His children.</p>
<p>His love for His children will never die.</p>
<p><strong>His betrayal by Lucifer, to whom He gave everything, has meant that His love for humanity has not been reciprocated by much of mankind.</strong></p>
<p>But as an ever loving Father, His love is so powerful that nothing can ever kill His love for His children.</p>
<p>His love means that every person has been given a second chance.</p>
<p>The Warning, a great Gift sanctioned by My Father, is a special calling from Heaven.</p>
<p>This calling, a great supernatural miracle, will give each of you the chance of being saved; of being called and of being given the key to open the door to the New Paradise on earth.</p>
<p>F<strong>or those of you who accept the Key to Paradise you will, in effect, defeat the beast</strong>.</p>
<p>The world will be finally rid of evil, sin, suffering and every pain.</p>
<p>Peace will reign.</p>
<p>Love for My Father will flourish finally and you will all live according to His Divine Will.</p>
<p>Love is a sign from God. No matter what religion or creed you follow love can only come from God.</p>
<p><strong>It is the light present in every soul, even those who are hardened sinners, for God does not extinguish his light ever.</strong></p>
<p>Grasp it. Embrace it. Cling on to love for it will lead you to Him.</p>
<p>Love will save you from the dark.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
