		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, <strong>more of My sacred servants are, at last, responding to My Call, although by doing so it means a very lonely journey for them.</strong></p>
<p>Their duty is to their superiors, for I have given My Church on Earth the authority to assert itself over all of God’s children. They, <strong>My sacred servants, must adhere to all instructions given to them by My Church, until the day My Sacraments are changed. Then, their duty will be to Me. </strong></p>
<p>To those of My sacred servants who do not believe in the prophecies foretold, where My Church on Earth will be destroyed from within, you need to pray, so that I will keep you strong and loyal to My Teachings, until the day of darkness will wipe out all Presence of Me in the Holy Tabernacles around the world. For when that happens, your only duty will be to Me, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Do not let your hearts be troubled, because once you proclaim only the Truth of My Teachings and administer the Sacraments in the ways in which you were taught, this will be your saving Grace. <strong>If, and when, you are instructed to reject the Truth of My Church on Earth, then this is when you will have to discern.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This day has not yet come, but when you are asked by those within your highest ranks to discard the Holy Eucharist, you will know then that you were given the Truth.</strong></p>
<p>When you are asked to accept certain doctrines, before that day comes, which you will know in your hearts could never be condoned by Me, you will realise the awful reality of the destruction, which faces the Church.</p>
<p><strong>It will only be the brave and the courageous amongst you, who will stand up for the Truth</strong> when they try to make you accept pagan lies, who will remain loyal to Me. You will continue to administer the Sacraments of Baptism, Holy Communion, Confession, Confirmation, Marriage and Extreme Unction.</p>
<p>The rest of My sacred servants will sign a pledge of allegiance to the new one world religion. It will be then that you will be divided into two – those who follow the Truth and those who will accept laws, which amount to only one thing – the adulation of false gods and the condonement of sin.</p>
<p>Many of you will no longer honour Me. If you do not remain loyal to Me and feed My flock with lies, many will be lost to Me. Yet, when these souls realise that they have been deceived, I will show great Mercy. You, however, having been trained to understand My Teachings, to honour My Holy Word and administer the Most Holy Sacraments, will betray Me.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
