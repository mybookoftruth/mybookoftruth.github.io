		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, it is My Desire that all My cherished followers pray hard to deflect the harm to souls, because of the growth of atheism. Atheism does not always declare itself. Very often, people who have decided, for whatever reason, to no longer believe in God, create a substitute.</p>
<p>Because of the makeup of man, he must seek out a cause in order to justify his existence. The curse of humanism is that it exalts man in the eyes of man. All that must be done, according to the humanist, is to ensure that man’s needs come first. Many people confuse humanism with Christianity. <strong>When one proclaims the importance of worldly goods in the lives of man, at all cost, in order to avoid suffering or poverty, it is easy to assume that this is a form of love for one’s neighbour.</strong></p>
<p>If you say that you want to put a stop to poverty, unemployment and other miseries, many will think you are speaking in the Name of God. <strong>Look behind the mask of humanism and you will not find signs of God, nor will you hear His Name mentioned.</strong> Those who live their lives as humanists do not love God. They only love themselves. They also believe that all that matters is the wellbeing – usually in the form of worldly things – of humanity, as a means to an end.</p>
<p>While it may seem charitable, to be seen to care about the needs of man, you can never substitute God, by placing the needs of man first. When you do this, you insult God. <strong>Humanism, while having all the exterior signs of love for God, is not what it seems</strong>. Behind the mask of love lurks a love of self. Man will die, his body will turn to dust, his soul will live on, yet, humanism would have you believe that man is immortal.</p>
<p>Be careful when you embrace humanism, because when you do, you cut yourselves off from Me.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
