		<p>Easter Sunday 24th April 2011 20.30 hours (8.30pm)</p>
<p>My dearly beloved daughter, today is significant in that My rising from the dead has fulfilled My promises to man, that by rising I will help lift all of you towards the Light of Heaven. Rise now, all of you, and come towards Me and your own salvation.</p>
<p>My children, you must convert others at every opportunity. The more you explain and the more you show those weak souls the love in your heart, then the final outcome will be achieved when you convert another soul. I will shower you with great blessings. This is a very special Gift from Me and represents an act of great mercy on your part.</p>
<p>Conversion, My children, will save souls. When a conversion takes place, this then spreads to those friends and acquaintances of the person who has been converted. Conversion spreads conversion. No matter if you are laughed at, or treated as if you are speaking nonsense. It takes much bravery on your part, My beloved loyal followers. But each time you stand up and explain My Teachings to others, people will listen. While some may smile at you and appear not to take you seriously, deep down many will listen to what you have to say.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit works through you during your work, the recipient will feel a tug at their heart. Yet they won’t know why. Then you will draw them closer.</p>
<p>Some people will be slow to respond. But be patient. They will begin to yield by degrees. First they will ask you a question. This will usually relate to whether something is right, or whether it is wrong. It will be then that the conversion takes root. Never give up spreading the Truth of My Teaching. This does not have to be done like a preacher. Rather it can be very subtle. Convert others in your everyday lives through ordinary conversation. This way people will be more receptive.</p>
<p>My children, you will feel shocked however, at other people’s reaction, especially those who are living their lives in denial and darkness. Their response will be aggressive and mocking in tone. You will be asked whether you really believe in such rubbish. Then you will be scolded and insulted. Your intelligence will be called into question. You will be accused of turning to religion because of personal difficulties. You will feel embarrassed from time to time and may find it hard to defend yourself. Stay silent in such situations. Then simply ask questions from time to time.</p>
<p>Ask such souls, “Why do you feel like this”? The more questions you ask of them the more these people will begin to evaluate their own answers. You will not convince everyone of the Truth. However, every attempt on your part will raise you up in My Eyes.</p>
<p>Go now, My children. Convert in My Name and you will be bestowed with many, many graces.</p>
<p>Your beloved Saviour<br>
Jesus
