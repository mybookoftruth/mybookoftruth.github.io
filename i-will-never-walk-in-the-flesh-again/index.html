		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, all those who say they come in My Name and claim that they are preparing the way for the Lord will make themselves be heard in every part of the world – many voices, many prophets, many liars – all of them, without the Authority of God.</p>
<p>Be alert when you hear, especially, the prophet who tells you that he has a duty to prepare you for My Second Coming. <strong>When you hear of these things and when you are told that I will appear in the world, in both body and soul, know that this is not the Truth. I repeat again, My Warning to the world. I will never walk in the flesh again. I came, the first time, in the flesh, but when I come again I will come in exactly the same way in which I left the Earth – in the clouds. </strong></p>
<p>Soon you will be shown great acts, which will be deemed to be great works in the preparation for My Second Coming. <strong>A number of carefully staged miraculous cures will be presented to the world by those enemies of God who will say that they are of Me</strong>. Many will be so taken aback that they will fall for this wicked deceit. So many wonders, great acts – all deemed to be by the Hand of God – will convince even the skeptics that divine miracles have occurred. <strong>Great accolades will be showered down on those false representatives, who say they lead My people. Soon the world will openly declare that these imposters are living saints and it won’t be long before they introduce the antichrist.</strong></p>
<p>All of this preparation has been planned for seven years and the speed in which such radical changes are being introduced is no coincidence. My Second Coming will become a regular discussion point. All will be asked to prepare for this Great Event, but errors in Christian doctrine will be abundant. Only those with eyes opened, who can see the Truth and those who are not afraid of facing the Truth, will see through these falsities. And for them, this will present a very heavy burden. Amid all the shouting, the lavish praises, which will be heaped on those who have stolen the Seats of Wisdom, there will be little talk of My Holy Word. All that will be talked about will be the importance of good deeds. Not one word about the work required to seek salvation, according to the Word of God.</p>
<p>When the secular world, finally relents and joins forces with the false imposters, who will take over the Temple of God, the time will be soon for the greatest abomination to be witnessed. That will be when the temple has been created to become the seat of the antichrist. By then, those who will adore the antichrist will be numbered in their billions. Those who know the Truth won’t have much time to wait, however, for the reign of the beast will be very short. And then the trumpet will be heard. On that day these enemies of God will be thrown into the lake of fire, exactly as prophesied.</p>
<p>Remember the prophecies. They will happen just as they were foretold – those imposters, who say they come in My Name, will be loved, applauded and idolised. Those who do come in My Name will be despised and hated. But from their mouths will come the Fire of the Spirit of Truth and by their suffering many others will be saved who would otherwise not have been.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
