		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, <strong>it is My Desire that My followers, including Christians of all denominations, spend more time in My Company at this time. </strong></p>
<p>No matter how close you may believe you are to Me, every effort by the evil one will be made to tempt you into every type of iniquity. Not one amongst you is so strong in your faith that you can withstand the influence of the spirit of evil. <strong>You must strive to spend more time in prayer, daily, and use this time to build around you the armour needed to protect you, if you are to remain true to Me.</strong> <strong>Failure to speak with Me, through prayer and the Sacraments, will render you weak, make you unsure of your love for Me and then you will leave yourself open to doubts about My Teachings, My Promises and My Power.</strong> The trials you will face, brought about with the advent of terror to be inflicted upon true followers of Mine, who will remain fiercely loyal to the Holy Word of God, will be very difficult.</p>
<p>You have been given free will by God, as your natural birthright and yet, those imposters who will invade My Church will try to take it away from you. <strong>You will be forced to accept untruths, presented to you under the guise of new renditions of the Holy Gospels and should you dare to question these, you will be expelled in disgrace.</strong> So many of you, through cowardice, blindness and a misguided devotion to those you believe lead My flock, will find yourselves embracing false doctrine.</p>
<p><strong>The false doctrine, which will be introduced, will be carefully camouflaged with loving words.</strong> The way to recognise that it does not come from Me will be threefold. It will place the needs of sinners first, by declaring that you must pray to elevate the rights of man to sin before the Lord. Secondly, you will be asked to declare that sin is a natural thing and that you must never fear the future because of it – that God will never reject a sinner and that all of His children will enter Paradise. Thirdly, you will be told that the Sacraments have to be adapted from their origins in Christianity to appeal to the heathen who deserve to have their human rights catered for in the Eyes of God. When these things take place, it will mean just one thing.  Man will present, before the altars of My Churches, everywhere, his interpretation of what Rules laid down by God suit him and what do not. He will then expect God to bow to his demands. He will, in effect, dictate to God because he will believe himself to be greater than Me.</p>
<p>I will cast these souls away from Me, for they will no longer be able to declare themselves to be Christians. By allowing themselves to be bullied by the heathen, they will become like heathen. <strong>There is no place in My Kingdom for those who do not give themselves to Me in the way I taught them, when I walked the Earth. You will find it difficult, in the years ahead, to remain loyal to My Teachings, because those who claim to represent Me will lead you into grave error, as foretold. Be careful.</strong> Watch what you will be asked to accept, as a substitute for My Holy Word. Those with true discernment, given to them by the Power of the Holy Spirit, will know immediately when these things happen. Others will not be blessed, because they will not have paid attention to everything I taught them. They will find themselves in a very dark and lonely place, without My Presence to Light the way of the Truth. That time is drawing very close.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
