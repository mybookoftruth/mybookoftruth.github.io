		<p>I am your beloved Mother, Queen of all the angels, Mother of God. I am the Immaculate Conception.</p>
<p>My children, don’t you know that my Son, at this time, is guiding all of you who come before Him with an open heart?</p>
<p>In order to give testimony to the Lord, God, through His only Son, you must remain true to His Teachings. They are carved in stone and as such can never change.<strong> The Truth can never change.</strong> All of God’s children were given the Truth, but not all accepted Who He was or where He came from. Those who do accept the Truth given to humanity by the Crucifixion of my beloved Son, Jesus Christ, must never forget what He told you.</p>
<p>He explained everything to you.<strong> Nothing has changed. You must remain alert at all times, because already you are being misled and soon many of you will fall into error. </strong></p>
<p>Sin is sin. It is displeasing to God, but is forgiven when remorse is shown and when you ask for redemption. The Graces of Eternal Life are for all of God’s children, who ask for these. <strong>Every child of God, through the Mercy of my Son, will be given time and then a great Gift to remind them of the Truth.</strong> In this way, most of the world’s population will and can be saved and then they will be given the Gift of Life in the New Paradise.</p>
<p>As a sinner, you must continue to ask for forgiveness through my Son, in order to remain in a State of Grace. You cannot be forgiven for your sins, until you ask my Son for the Gift of Reconciliation.</p>
<p><strong>You must remain true to what my Son taught you. He was like you in everything except sin.</strong> God is Almighty. God is Love. God is Perfect. God, through His Son, could never be tempted into committing sin.</p>
<p>Go in peace, dear children, and once you remain firm and loyal to the Truth, which can only come from God, you will live a full and glorious life in body and soul and in perfect harmony with my Son.</p>
<p>Your Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
