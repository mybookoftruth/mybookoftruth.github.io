		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, <strong>when you are close to My Heart and when souls surrender in full to Me, a number of things happen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Firstly, any fear of human interference in your lives, will disappear.</strong> In its place will be the peace and contentment, which comes from Me when I truly reside in your heart and soul. No amount of abuse, cruelty or criticism can penetrate your soul, because you will have handed this pain over to Me. This is why you must always remain calm and silent in the face of such attacks.</p>
<p><strong>The next Grace you will be given will be the strength to withstand the temptation to sin.</strong> This temptation, which is placed before all souls, every single day, by the devil, is very powerful and very few people have the willpower to avoid falling into sin. But when you have abandoned your will to Mine, it is My Will which will reside within your soul, which will then overcome the temptations placed before you.</p>
<p><strong>Never, ever, underestimate how much of a stranglehold Satan has over the human race.</strong> This power is like a powerful storm and just as a strong, fierce gust of wind can knock you to the ground, the seduction, placed before you by the evil one, is akin to a force, which will lift you in seconds and propel you into the sin, which you try to avoid.</p>
<p>Man is born with sin. Through the Sacrament of Baptism, the power of the beast is weakened. Then, as you go through life’s many trials and temptations, every person will be enticed into sin of every kind. Only those who work hard to avoid sin will overcome the fierce battle, which the evil one will mount to devour their souls. Regular communication with Me is important. All you need to do is to talk with Me in your own words. Ask Me regularly to forgive you for the sins for which you are remorseful. Receive the Sacraments regularly. Then, finally, trust in Me, for when you do, I have the Power to pull you back from the brink of sin. When you surrender your will to Me, My Will will become the driving force to protect you against Satan.</p>
<p>By abandoning yourselves to Me entirely, you will perfect your soul.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
