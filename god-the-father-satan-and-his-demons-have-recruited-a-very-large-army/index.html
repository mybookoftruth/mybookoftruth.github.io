		<p>My dearest daughter, My Divine Powers are given to all of My children who turn to Me, asking Me – through My Son – to sustain them during these times of great trials on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Sin is so rampant that My Son now suffers the same Agony, which He endured for each of you on the Cross.</strong> Sin is so widespread that you have all become immune to it and the evil which it breathes. My children, you must come to Me and never give up your quest for peace and love. Never think that I will not hear your voices, as they call out to Me, no matter how little you are.</p>
<p>My Son’s Second Coming will create great havoc, division, mistrust, hatred and sadness, as the Truth of My Holy Word will be thrown to one side. <strong>Satan and his demons have recruited a very large army – an army so big and powerful that it would be beyond belief if you could see how it has been formed. This army controls what you, My children, are being told in public. Very rarely, from now on, will you be told the Truth.</strong> By this I mean the Truth, according to My Most Holy Covenant.</p>
<p>All matters relating to the world in which you live will not be truly revealed to you, as wars, deliberately created to destroy My people, will soon be witnessed. None of these wars will be for the good of man nor will they be just. My Word, given to the world, since the first prophet revealed My Desires, will no longer be taken seriously. <strong>The Word, according to My Son, Jesus Christ, will be abused and defiled in order to justify lies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is time for all those who are called to the service of My Son to remain alert. </strong>You cannot ignore this, My Call to humanity. I, through My Son, ask you to stay together, in union with Him at all times. You, My children, are Satan’s first target, as he will not rest until he seizes My Son’s Church on Earth, first. Without My Son’s Church, he will fail to draw the souls he craves the most. You, My children, will be hurt and tormented by the beast – the antichrist – if you cave into pressures which force you to embrace the new false doctrine, which is now being carefully and ruthlessly prepared.</p>
<p><strong>I, the Father of all of you, God the Most High, wish it to be made known that the antichrist is about to be embraced by My enemies in secret rituals. He is being sworn in behind hidden walls, in places, which are meant for the Adoration of My Son.</strong> The ecclesiastical masonry, which will now be witnessed, plays an important role in this abomination. Sadly, all of this must take place before My Covenant to gather all My children, back into the Paradise I created for them, in the first instance, is completed.</p>
<p><strong>It will be up to those of you, chosen by Me, to always acknowledge the Truth, so that you can help My Son to save the other souls who will swear an oath to follow the beast.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My Son’s Image, common throughout the world, will soon be replaced by the image of the false prophet.</strong> His image will be adored first, instead of that of My Son. <strong>Then this will be followed by large images, in every kind of format, of the beast, whose sign 666 will be embedded within every single mark he makes upon an unsuspecting world. You will see this sign hidden in such wicked objects, which will be used just as one would carry holy objects</strong>. A form of rosary beads will be created to idolise the new, soon to be declared, union of the world’s churches. The new world religion will be celebrated by the taking of holy prayer books, medals, scapulars, rosary beads, Crosses and desecrating them into becoming good luck charms.</p>
<p>Everyone will love the antichrist, as he will represent the world outside of religion, on the one hand, but because he will be embraced by the false imposter in My Son’s Church on Earth, he will be seen to represent all that is sacred in the world.</p>
<p>My children, do not let news of these events tear at your heart, for when you listen to Me, and follow the Path of My Son, I will spare you much of the persecution of spirit, which is to come. Your adherence to these Messages will be weakened from time to time, by attacks planted by Satan. Some of you will walk away. Some of you will doubt. The vast majority of you will remain true to Me and I will grant you great Favours and Graces for your obedience.</p>
<p>I love you children. I will be merciful and when you ask Me, through My Son, to soothe your hearts and help you to remain at peace and walk with confidence towards the Gates of My New Paradise, I will answer your call.</p>
<p>Your loving Father</p>
<p>God the Most High</p>
