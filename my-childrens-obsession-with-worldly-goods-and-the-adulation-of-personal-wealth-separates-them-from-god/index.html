		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, as humanity sinks deeper into sin, they continue to search for material things, which they believe will satisfy the raw pain they feel inside, for nothing can bring them comfort when they are so far removed from Me. Not for one moment do they think of Me, so caught up are they in the pursuit of worldly goods – useless things – which bring nothing, only a longing for more and more.</p>
<p>Then there are those whose love of worldly attractions means that they become insatiable. They seek bigger and what they believe to be more valuable possessions. Eventually they build shrines to themselves. This is when they plunge into despair, because the more wealth and luxury they acquire, the more confused and distracted they become. They will lose interest in other people and soon they will become isolated, as they become caught in a spider’s web, spun by the spirit of evil to trap them and destroy their souls.</p>
<p>My children’s obsession with worldly goods and the adulation of personal wealth separates them from God. <strong>Your own love of possessions destroys your love of your neighbor. You will become selfish to the point that you will not care about the misfortunes of others.</strong> This is how you disobey the Word of God.</p>
<p>You must stop your pursuit of riches. Then you will become purer of heart. But<strong> allow this devious sin to cloud your mind and you will never be pure of soul, and thereby not fit to come before Me.</strong> Those who are poor have less to tempt them to separate themselves from Me. <strong>Those who are rich are poor in that they have much to learn before they can humble themselves in My Eyes.</strong></p>
<p>When will you learn that when man places worldly pleasures before Me, that he will not be able to prepare his soul in order to enter My New Paradise?</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
