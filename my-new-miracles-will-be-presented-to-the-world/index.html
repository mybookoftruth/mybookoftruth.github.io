		<p>My dearest beloved daughter, you must remain brave throughout your suffering and not allow fear to enter your heart.</p>
<p>In union, truly with Me, your suffering coincides with the week, which commemorates My death on the Cross.</p>
<p>This is not a coincidence. <strong>For the suffering that you and other such chosen souls endure, during this week, will save millions of souls from the fires of Hell.</strong></p>
<p>Just as I endured pain, torture and death, to save mankind from eternal damnation, so too, do victim souls save other souls, so that they can be given the Gift of Eternal Life.</p>
<p><strong>No matter how difficult and frightening this suffering is, always remember the Gift to humanity that it represents.</strong></p>
<p>Children, as Holy Week commences, please meditate on My Passion on the Cross.</p>
<p>Not just on the suffering, but on the Gift of freedom that it offers the whole of humanity.</p>
<p>Not one soul, including the cruel and hardened sinner, influenced by Satan, will be excluded from My Mercy.</p>
<p>The Mercy, which has been made possible, because of the Gift My beloved Father gave the world.</p>
<p>When He sent Me, His one and only Son, He made the biggest Sacrifice of all.</p>
<p>This Sacrifice, proof of His ardent Love for all of His children, has meant that it is possible to destroy Satan once and for all.</p>
<p>Because of the free will, given to humanity by My Father, each man will be given the choice.</p>
<p>You will either be for My Father or against Him.</p>
<p>You will choose either the Paradise of Eternal Life or the horror of Hell.</p>
<p>Satan, as his days are almost at an end will not sit back, while My new miracles will be presented to the world at this time.</p>
<p>Not only will he attack those dark souls, in order to tempt them into further darkness and closer to his domain, he will target devout Christians.</p>
<p><strong>The miracles I speak of are firstly, My communications through you, My daughter. My Voice is being heard and conversion is multiplying.</strong></p>
<p>Millions of souls are now being claimed by Me, through these Messages.</p>
<p><strong>The other miracles include the great Gift of My Mercy I bring into the world shortly, when The Warning takes place.</strong></p>
<p>For the first time, every single man, woman and child will be given the proof, that not only does God, the Father, Exist, but that I, Jesus Christ, His only Son, also Exists.</p>
<p>This means that all those religions, including the Jewish people, My chosen people from whom I came, will realise the Truth.</p>
<p>The miracle of global conversion will infuriate Satan, who will not give up even at that stage. Those poor souls, already in terrible sin, will find it very difficult to pull away from him.</p>
<p>Other miracles will include global events, which will involve <strong>ecological wonders, which will be given by My Father, out of His Love for His Two Witnesses, the Christians and the Jews.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Power will be given to these two Faiths when they are being persecuted.</strong></p>
<p>Their enemies will suffer as they inflict terrible punishment on them.</p>
<p><strong>And then there will be My Second Coming, the greatest miracle since My Resurrection.</strong></p>
<p>This will be the Day I come to Judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p><strong>This is the Day I come to gather My family so that we become one.</strong></p>
<p>This will be the beginning of My Reign, as Heaven and Earth merge, to become one for 1,000 years.</p>
<p><strong>At this time, all will live by the Divine Will of My Father.</strong></p>
<p>Your beloved Jesus</p>
