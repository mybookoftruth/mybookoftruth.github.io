		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, why is that people complicate My Teachings? So many of My children misunderstand and underestimate My great Mercy. Despite the number of times I promise My children forgiveness for their sins they are still afraid that I cannot forgive all sin, no matter how grievous the sin.</p>
<p>Evil in the world is caused by the hatred that Satan has for mankind. Those poor, deluded sinners who slavishly follow the path of deceit are My beloved children. I love each of them and I will continue to love them despite their darkness of soul. My Love is everlasting and will never die when it comes to all souls. I Am ready to completely forgive and embrace all. I Am prepared to do everything to bring all sinners back into My fold no matter how they offend Me.</p>
<p>Satan will be stopped from stealing such souls, but it will only be when the shield of pride is discarded by sinners, that they can turn to Me and become part of My cherished family again. Do not misunderstand. I can only bring souls closer to Me. I cannot force them to love Me. I cannot force them to want to enter My Kingdom of Paradise. They will have to accept My Hand of Reconciliation first, through their own free will.</p>
<p>I Am, as I have told you, My daughter, time and time again, a God of Mercy first. My Justice will materialise, but only when every exhaustive measure has been taken to save every single soul on Earth.</p>
<p>My daughter, this Work was never going to be easy for you. Because I have given you this holy task of such magnitude, it will require tremendous strength on your part. You are made to be strong. You have been trained for this Work since you came from your mother’s womb. All your responses to My most holy instructions have been according to My divine plan for humanity. It is because you are in union with Me – Have you forgotten this? – that you will suffer the same rejection, that I had to endure during My time on Earth. This same rejection by those who boast of their intellectual knowledge of My Teachings, in order to reject these Messages of Mine, witnessed by you in the world today. Those souls, stuffed with pride and their self proclaimed knowledge of Holy Scripture, fail to understand this.</p>
<p>My Teachings are very simple. Add in all the fine language and prose you like, the Truth remains as it always has been. Love one another as I love you. It will be only when you show respect for each other and love one another that you can truly proclaim My Word.</p>
<p>So much confusion exists, My daughter. So much terror and fear instilled in My children about their future. If only souls would calm down and pray for Mercy, then their prayers would be answered. Disasters will and can be mitigated. Keep hope alive in your souls, children. Never get bogged down with judging each other and certainly never do this in My Name.</p>
<p>Who dares to judge another through ridicule, in the name of Christianity, will have to face Me. He who sins against My prophets will also have to answer to Me. My Word is not rejected out of love. My Word is not rejected out of fear. No, it is rejected because of the sin of pride.</p>
<p>Your Saviour<br>
Jesus
