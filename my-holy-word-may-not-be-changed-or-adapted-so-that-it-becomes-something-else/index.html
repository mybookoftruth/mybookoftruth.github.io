		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, while I continue to make every effort to reach out to the world, through these Messages – still many devout followers of Mine, fail to accept My Hand. <strong>These precious souls of Mine are vulnerable because many will fail to see the way in which their faith will be used to endorse the new, soon-to-be liturgy, which will fail to honor Me, Jesus Christ, the Son of man.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Many will assume, incorrectly, that the new liturgy and the new mass – although changed greatly – can do no harm. </strong>So many will quietly question some of the contents, as well as the format and find them strange. Yet very few will challenge them as they will believe that these are blessed by the Church and so therefore, they cannot be wrong. What they do not understand is that My Holy Word may not be changed or adapted so that it becomes something else. <strong>My Church is infallible, but should any so-called servant or leader in My Church twist the Word of God or rewrite the meaning of the Holy Eucharist, then they blaspheme against God. </strong></p>
<p>I was denied by humanity and crucified when they, including the leaders in God’s Temples, rejected the Truth. <strong>When anyone – no matter how high they stand amongst you – denies the Truth, they are guilty of heresy and do not come from Me.</strong> Yet, they would have you believe that the Truth is a lie. They will deny all that you have been taught by Me to live full Christian lives. They will spit at Me, but lead you along a path, which they will say leads you to Me, but it will not.</p>
<p><strong>These things, foretold, will soon come to pass.</strong> Be prepared. When you see the signs, then know that these prophecies can only come from God.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
