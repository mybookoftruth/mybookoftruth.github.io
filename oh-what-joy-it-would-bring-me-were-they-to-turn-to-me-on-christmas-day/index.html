		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, this is a message for the world, for Christmas Day. As all of you celebrate My Birthday, allow Me to enter your heart on this special day – for this day is Mine.</p>
<p>Invite Me into your home as a favoured guest and introduce Me to those amongst your family, friends and neighbours, who may have forgotten about Me. Christmas may be a celebration about Me, but I Am ignored amidst the great rejoicings, which take place. Allow mention of Me to gladden your hearts, to bring you joy and to bring you hope for the future – a future I secured for you from the day I was born.</p>
<p><strong>Remind those who no longer revere Me, of the Love that I have for them and how I long to be part of their lives again. Oh what joy it would bring Me were they to turn to Me on Christmas Day and ask Me to bring them My Peace and My Love. If they would come to Me on Christmas Day I would envelop them into the safety of My Divine Refuge and never let them separate from Me again.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My beloved followers, you are My Family, and I am your family. Through My Mercy, I take you into the Bosom of My Beloved Father, Who loves you with the passion of a tender-hearted parent. Oh how He loves you and how much pleasure He feels when you acknowledge Me, and call on Me, for My Help.</strong></p>
<p>You mean everything to Me and My Love for you is all encompassing, way beyond your comprehension.  It is therefore with a fiery compassion and fierce determination that I will fight for every one of you, to save you from the wickedness of My enemies. I guard your souls with great jealousy and will fight the good fight to bring you safe and sound into My Kingdom. No matter how I am opposed; how much Christians have to suffer humiliation in My Name; however much seduction is placed before you by My adversary – I will win this battle for souls. That is a fact for nothing can stand between God and His children for He will not permit it. The man who does, will be toppled. Hatred will be destroyed and lies will be revealed for the shallowness upon which they were created. The Truth will stand the test of time.</p>
<p><strong>I Am coming soon to unite God’s children –  His precious family. Lift your hearts, do not allow My foes to dampen your spirit and let hope be your only thought.  Have complete confidence in My Great Mercy and be ready to welcome Me, your Saviour and Redeemer, back into your lives.  Rejoice, for My Promises will bring with them a cause for the greatest joy. This Christmas will be joyful, for My Time is short.</strong></p>

<p>Your beloved Jesus</p>
