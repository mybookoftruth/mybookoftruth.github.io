		<p>My dear child, just as the Holy Spirit, a Gift from God, descended upon my Son’s apostles, so too will It be poured over all those who love my Son in these times. </p>
<p><strong>My Father has many plans, which He will enact, in order to save every single child of His. These plans cover many miraculous events, including the pouring out of special Grace, revelations given to you through these Messages, to ensure that God’s children do not stray along the wrong path, and many other interventions.</strong> <strong>Some of these interventions will be in the form of ecological punishments. When they become so constant, man will no longer be able to say that floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and hurricanes are caused by man’s neglect of the Earth</strong>.</p>
<p>God is in control of the Earth, for He created it. He will decide its fate – no one else – for all Power belongs to Him.</p>
<p><strong>My Father will shake the world both physically and spiritually</strong>, while the plans and wicked deeds of the evil one flourish in every nation. Each act of desecration against God will be matched by His retaliations, which will wield an unbearable chastisement. Man’s sin will be fought vehemently by my Father and man must never underestimate the Power of God.</p>
<p>God’s Love must never be taken for granted. He must never be viewed as being weak, just because His Love for His children is unfathomable. His Mercy is great and all those who love God will be spared during the tribulations, which will be unleashed upon humanity, as God is thrown to one side, in favour of false gods and humanity’s obsession with itself.</p>
<p><strong>Pray, pray, pray because all things foretold, in the preparation for the Second Coming of my Son, will commence now.</strong> Events will be swift and Satan’s army will storm my Son’s Churches with measured steps, so that few will notice. Then they won’t care, because not long afterwards, they will have so many deceived and within their clutches, that they will no longer have to hide their true intentions.</p>
<p>You, my dear children, must prepare now, remain calm, do everything you have been instructed to do and pray. Stay together. Bring other souls the Truth, pray hard for the conversion of those who do not believe in God and for all those who insult the memory of my Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
