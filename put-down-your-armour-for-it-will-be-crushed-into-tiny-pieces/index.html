		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, My enemies may scorn My Word – the Truth – but the day will come when they will hang their heads in shame and remorse when they stand before Me.</p>
<p><strong>In the days of Noah, he and those chosen to help him to prepare for the Justice of God, were ridiculed. They were sneered at, persecuted and every attempt was made to discredit the instructions given to Noah by God</strong>.  Obedient to the last, Noah begged for mercy for their souls. He urged them to seek refuge with him but he was ignored. And so it will be up to the Great Day of the Lord. Only a remnant will be ready to greet Me along with all those, who will find it in their hearts to accept My Mercy, during the Warning.</p>
<p>I ask all those who believe in Me, and My Promise to come again in great glory, to pray for those who scorn this mission for they have been given the Gift of the Truth but choose to throw it back in My Face.  All those with warm and tender hearts, and a meekness of soul, will be drawn into My Arms, no matter what faith or creed they follow, for they are of Me. Those who do not know the Word of God will be shown great mercy and those who convert during the Warning will also dwell in My Arms. I will reach out to all souls, whose hearts are warm and who show love and mercy to their brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>The greatest battle will be when I reach out to the arrogant and proud, who lack true love and who are without a generous spirit. It is for these souls that I urge your prayers. But, it will be for those who have sold their souls to the devil, in the full knowledge of what they have done, that I ask you to beg for My Mercy the most. They will not come to Me, on their own accord, and so it will only be through the suffering of chosen souls, who have consecrated themselves to Me, and your own offerings, that they can be saved. Please recite this prayer to save all sinners.</p>
<p><em><strong>Crusade Prayer (169) For the salvation of those who reject Christ</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Dearest Jesus, by Your Compassion and Mercy,</em></p>
<p><em>I beg you for the salvation of those who have rejected You;</em></p>
<p><em>Who deny Your Existence;</em></p>
<p><em>Who deliberately oppose Your Holy Word and whose bitter hearts have poisoned their souls against the Light and the Truth of Your Divinity.</em></p>
<p><em>Have Mercy on all sinners.</em></p>
<p><em>Forgive those who blaspheme against the Holy Trinity and</em></p>
<p><em>Help me, in my own way, and through my personal sacrifices, to embrace within Your Loving Arms, those sinners who need Your Mercy the most.</em></p>
<p><em>I give You my promise, that through my thoughts, my actions and the spoken word, to serve You as best I can in Your Mission of Salvation.</em></p>
<p><em>Amen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Go all of you and gather in prayer, for the Justice of God will be seen soon for the world to witness.</strong>  It is because of the wickedness of man, his peevish actions and his hatred for his fellow man that God will stop him from the devastation, which is being orchestrated in every way against the human race.</p>
<p>Put down your armour, for it will be crushed into tiny pieces by the Hand of My Eternal Father. <strong>Oppose God and you will suffer for this. But when you try to hurt humanity on a large scale through the abuse of power, you will be stopped abruptly. You will have no time to seek God’s Mercy.</strong></p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
