		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, it is not necessary to worry about human opinion.</p>
<p>The views of mankind are nothing, when compared to My Holy Words, given to you.</p>
<p>My Word comes first. No other views against My Word should concern you.</p>
<p><strong>Time, My daughter, is very short now for Me to save humanity.</strong></p>
<p>My daughter, so much will now be expected of you, so quickly, that you will not be able to draw your breath.</p>
<p><strong>There are many revelations now being imparted to you, so that My children know how to prepare themselves properly.</strong></p>
<p>Should you allow distractions, such as people’s opinions or views, to take up your time, unnecessarily, then this will take you away from the Work, which is truly important.</p>
<p>Allow Me to fill you with love and comfort at this time, My daughter.</p>
<p>The Warning is very close. As soon as My Rays of Mercy envelop the whole world, anyone who believes in Me, will repent.</p>
<p>Those who denounce My Messages, given to you, and who love Me, will turn back to My Sacred Heart, with love and joy in their souls.</p>
<p><strong>No sooner will The Warning have taken place, than a number of events will occur.</strong></p>
<p>The antichrist and his group, although weakened as a result of the Global Confession, <strong>will begin to plan his seizure of My Holy Church from within</strong><b>.</b></p>
<p>My Army will take position, and begin to fight, to save the Holy Catholic Church, from ruination. <strong>They, the false prophet and his followers, will not win</strong>, My daughter, but how I cry for those sacred servants of Mine who will fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>So deluded will they be, that they will think they are following the orthodox Catholic Church.</p>
<p>In fact, they will be siding with the <strong>false prophet, who will rule over My Holy See, with pride and contempt in his heart</strong>.</p>
<p>You, My daughter, must ask My children to pray hard, in order to mitigate this abomination.</p>
<p>I need prayer to save the souls of My poor, misguided priests, bishops and cardinals, blind to the Truth.</p>
<p><strong>The Holy Seat of Peter will be desecrated by Satan’s fallen angels, in league with the antichrist and his various organisations.</strong></p>
<p>All are one, My daughter, spawned from Satan.</p>
<p>I know that this is frightening, but it will not last long. Prayer, and much of it, will ease and help avert these events.</p>
<p>Prepare your souls now, children, by going to Confession, if you are Catholic, as soon as you can. Otherwise I urge all of you to seek redemption for your sins with a purity of heart.</p>
<p>This will ease your suffering of penance at The Warning. Afterwards, you must pray for peace on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Preparations for My Second Coming will commence immediately after The Warning takes place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The sealed Book of Truth will be opened and the secrets revealed through you, My daughter, for the whole world to see.</strong></p>
<p>My Book of Truth will be given to the world, so that your souls are purified, in union with Me.</p>
<p>Only then, will you be ready to come with Me, into the Era of <strong>My Father’s Divine Will</strong>, the <strong>Era of Peace, My New Paradise on Earth</strong>.</p>
<p>Your beloved Jesus</p>
<p>Saviour of
