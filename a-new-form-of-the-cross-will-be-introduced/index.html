		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, My Authority will never diminish, and like a light, will fade amidst the thick fog, but it will always be visible, even though it may be reduced to but just a faint glimmer.</p>
<p>When the world changes again, as the spirit of evil creates division upon division, it will only be the Light of God which will sustain you. My Presence will be felt by those who come to Me for help, for I will never desert you, especially when you feel that all is hopeless. Nothing but the Truth will help you to cope, when the lack of charity which is evident in the world today increases, as men’s hearts turn to stone.</p>
<p>The Truth is contained in the Holy Bible. It is the food by which man can live now and in the future. <b>Very soon it will become impossible to buy a Bible, as many nations will adhere to the new laws, especially in Europe, which will ban all books which promote the Word of God.</b></p>
<p><b>The letter is being written now to beckon all those in the service of the Catholic Church.</b> Soon, all of My sacred servants will be informed of the changes, which they will be told are for the good of the Church.</p>
<p><b>The new rules, which will see amendments made to prayers during the Holy Mass, will seem innocent. To many, they won’t notice the significance, but it will relate to the Holy Eucharist and My Presence within It. The word ‘commemorate’ will be used and all churches will soon be stripped bare of their treasures. The taking of treasures, including gold Tabernacles – which will be replaced by those made of wood and stone – will be one of the signs that they are being gathered for the New World Religion.</b></p>
<p>Churches will be changed within their walls and this will involve the desecration of altars. The Monstrance,  holding the Holy Eucharist, will begin to disappear and the days when My Holy Host is exposed will come to an end.</p>
<p>Cast scorn upon My Word now, and you will weep tears when these acts are brought before you. Soon, not long afterwards, the garments worn by My sacred servants, will be altered and a new form of the Cross will be introduced. The new atrocity will not be based on the simple cross. Instead it will feature, discreetly, the head of the beast.</p>
<p>I ask you to gather My holy Crosses now and keep them in your homes, along with Holy Water. I urge all of you to hold onto the Truth of what I have told you. Then I want you to trust in Me completely. Never believe that I Am leaving you at the mercy of the evil one. I will remain close to you at all times. I will pour special blessings on the heads of My beloved, loyal sacred servants to keep them entwined with My Sacred Heart.</p>
<p>Keep your hearts close to Me and to each other. Comfort and strengthen each other, for you must love each other, more than ever, before and during the times ahead. I Am your family.  You are Mine. We will remain united, until the time when the trumpets peal out and the announcement is made that I Am to reveal Myself, finally, in My Second Coming. Then you will feel the joy and peace which I have promised you. Then all suffering will end.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
