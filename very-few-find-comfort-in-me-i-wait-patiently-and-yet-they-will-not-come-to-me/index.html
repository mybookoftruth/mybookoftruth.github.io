		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, My Tears flow today, as the wretchedness of evil, which has been manifested within the hearts of man, increases. <b>So hardened have they become that their hearts of stone leave no room for Me, Jesus Christ, to find solace within.</b></p>
<p>My Heart heaves with sadness now, for Christians who have fallen away from the Truth and all I taught them. Very few find comfort in Me. I wait patiently and yet they will not come to Me. They have created a wall which separates them from Me and pay lip service to My Promise to come again. How they have forgotten what I said, what I did to save them and what I told them through My Father’s Book, to expect the time, when it draws close.</p>
<p>My poor, poor children. I need to awaken love for Me in their hearts, first, if they are to receive the comfort and ease of pain from their sorrowful and difficult trials in this life. <b>They must hold out their arms and call on Me now, at this time, if I Am to make the transition painless for them.</b></p>
<p>I have no desire to inflict suffering on God’s children. But, by rejecting the Truth of My Teachings and the Laws laid down by My Father, they will be dragged into a terrible battle with the spirit of evil, before My Mercy can draw them into My Arms when I will save them.</p>
<p>How little trust they hold in their hearts, for the One True God. How flippant they are and how quickly they embrace falsehoods, in order to satisfy their lust for sin. How gullible they are when they accept lies, which suit their lifestyles, in order to justify sin.</p>
<p>Anything plausible, which justifies sin through human intellect, is the only route they choose, so that they can live their lives as they wish. <b>The Truth is so difficult to swallow and it is hard to digest, in that sacrifices of the flesh have to be made in order to accept it. The Truth, if and when it is accepted, takes great courage and only those who have the Gift of Humility can truly embrace it with ease.</b></p>
<p>Those who genuinely seek the Truth of God are often misled by those who say that they proclaim the Word of God. The only place you will find the Truth is in the Most Holy Bible and in My Holy Word given to you through these Messages. My Messages uphold the Holy Word of God, as it is laid down in My Father’s Book.</p>
<p>Loving Me is not easy, for you can only come to Me as a simple child. Your airs and graces, which you present to the world in your day-to-day life, must be left to one side. You can only come to Me, as a simple, trusting child. You must lay before Me and ask Me to take you, mold you, help you to walk the right path to holiness and then to trust in Me completely.</p>
<p>Once you surrender all to Me, I will lift you, take away your fear and I will carry you towards My Kingdom. Even then, with the Love of God in your soul, you will find this path difficult. But, it will be as if the cobwebs have been cleared away, because once the Truth becomes clear there will be no other road you will wish to walk down. For this is the only road which will lead you to Paradise and that is the route you must take to come to Me, Jesus Christ. For, I Am the Way.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
