		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, the timing of My Father’s Will is not for your knowing.</p>
<p>My followers must be patient, as everything in the world will evolve as prophesised in My Father’s Book.</p>
<p>All of this will be according to My Father’s timing and the effect that your prayers will have, in helping to avert global wars.</p>
<p>It is not long for all My Promises to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>You, My followers, must trust in Me, your beloved Jesus.</p>
<p>Pray for souls and leave everything in My Hands.</p>
<p>Never forget to pray to My Father, as often as you can, for the Seal of the Living God, in order to protect you and your families.</p>
<p><b>Crusade Prayer (33) to ask for the Seal of the Living God and accept it with love, joy and gratitude.</b></p>
<p><strong><em>“O my God, my loving Father, I accept with love and gratitude, Your Divine Seal of Protection.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Your Divinity encompasses my body and soul for eternity. I bow in humble thanksgiving and offer my deep love and loyalty to You, my beloved Father.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I beg You to protect me and my loved ones with this special Seal and I pledge my life to Your service forever and ever. I love You, dear Father. I console You in these times, dear Father.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I offer you the Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your dearly beloved Son, in atonement for the sins of the world and for the salvation of all Your children. Amen.”</em></strong></p>
<p><b>Ensure also that you encourage others to pray the seven-day Crusade Prayer (24) to seek redemption for your sins.</b></p>
<p><strong><em>“O my Jesus, You are the Light of the Earth. You are the Flame that touches all souls. Your Mercy and Love knows no bounds. We are not worthy of the Sacrifice You made by Your death on the Cross. Yet we know that Your Love for us is greater than the love we hold for You. Grant us, O Lord, the Gift of humility so that we are deserving of Your New Kingdom. Fill us with the Holy Spirit, so we can march forth and lead Your Army to proclaim the Truth of Your Holy Word and prepare our brothers and sisters for the Glory of Your Second Coming on Earth.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We honour You. We praise You. We offer ourselves, our sorrows, our sufferings as a gift to You to save souls. We love You, Jesus. Have Mercy on all Your children wherever they may be. Amen.”</em></strong></p>
<p>To those who challenge this special Gift of prayer, in which I offer Total Absolution, you must know this.</p>
<p>I Am Jesus Christ, the Son of man and have been given the Authority to forgive all sins.</p>
<p>My sacred priests have also been given the power to forgive sin, through the holy Sacrament of Confession.</p>
<p>I request that you accept My Gift of Absolution, for the benefit of those who cannot receive the Sacrament of Confession or for those who are not members of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Would you deny these precious souls the right to My Gift?</p>
<p>Why would you try to discourage those souls, who accept My Divine Word, from receiving Absolution? Would you rather they did not redeem themselves in My Eyes?</p>
<p>You must show love to your brothers and sisters and be happy that they are being given this special Gift by Me, their beloved Jesus.</p>
<p>Even if they never read My Messages given to you, My daughter, every sinner has the right to ask Me to forgive them once they show true remorse in their souls.</p>
<p>Open your hearts and pray for the Gift of humility.</p>
<p>Don’t you know that the Holy Spirit cannot and will not enter the souls of those with hardened hearts?</p>
<p>Your Divine Saviour</p>
<p>Jesus Christ</p>
