		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, man must turn away from sin and soon. So many sins today, are no longer seen as such.</p>
<p>So many grievances, against My Father, are committed without any guilt.</p>
<p>Children, you must stop. You are destroying your lives. Satan taunts Me, as he boasts of those souls he steals from Me, every single second. <strong>If you saw the souls, millions of them, tumbling into the fires of eternity, you would die of shock.</strong></p>
<p>How it breaks My Heart to witness the terror that these souls, who lived in terrible sin when they were on Earth, have to suffer. The sins they were guilty of are not always those you presume to be mortal sin.</p>
<p>I talk about <strong>fornication</strong>, so easily accepted in the world today, participating in and viewing <strong>pornography, prostitution</strong> and <strong>sexual abuse</strong>.</p>
<p>I refer to hatred for others, as well as, those who cause pain and misery to those less fortunate than themselves.</p>
<p>So, too, is <strong>the sin of idolatry</strong> where you worship material goods, above everything else, yet they are nothing, but ashes.</p>
<p>Do you not understand that once you sin in this way, you become further removed from Me, every day? Then it becomes very difficult to free yourself from the grip placed upon you by the king of darkness.</p>
<p><strong>Wake up, children. Be aware of the existence of Hell and be very fearful of entering the gates of eternal damnation.</strong></p>
<p>I tell you this not to frighten you, but to ensure that you understand that mortal sin will lead you there unless you turn back to Me now.</p>
<p>Prayer, and much of it, will be needed to turn back to Me, but hear this. To those of you who are desperate, sorrowful and feel helpless, because of the abyss of sin you are in, just ask and I will forgive you.</p>
<p>You must show true remorse and go to Confession, now. If you cannot go to Confession then say My <strong>Crusade Prayer for a Plenary Indulgence for Absolution</strong>, for a period of seven consecutive days.</p>
<p><strong><em>“O my Jesus, You are the Light of the Earth.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>You are the Flame that touches all souls.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Your Mercy and Love knows no bounds.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We are not worthy of the Sacrifice You made by Your death on the Cross.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Yet we know that Your Love for us is greater than the love we hold for You.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Grant us, O Lord, the Gift of humility so that we are deserving of Your New Kingdom.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Fill us with the Holy Spirit, so we can march forth and lead Your Army to proclaim the Truth of Your Holy Word and prepare our brothers and sisters for the Glory of Your Second Coming on Earth.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We honour You. We praise You. We offer ourselves, our sorrows, our sufferings as a gift to You to save souls.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We love You, Jesus. Have Mercy on all Your children wherever they may be. Amen.”</em></strong></p>
<p>I never give up on sinners and feel a particular affection for them. I love them in a very special way, but detest their sins.</p>
<p>Help Me to save you, children. Do not leave it until it is too late.</p>
<p>Your beloved Jesus</p>
