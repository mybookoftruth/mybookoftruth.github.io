		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, it is time for the Second Seal to open, as wars will increase and spread.</p>
<p>The avenging dark angel comes from one source, My daughter, and these wars are all connected.</p>
<p>They did not happen because of regional unrest. They were planned by the West.</p>
<p>These wars have been ignited, deliberately, in order to control, and many of these nations are painted as demonic, with lies spread about their political leaders.</p>
<p>Children, these wars have been cunningly set up, all at once, the objective being to remove leader after leader.</p>
<p>Peaceful solutions will be presented and applauded, but they are false.</p>
<p>You, My children, are being deceived.</p>
<p>Rumour of war is just that – rumour. How do rumours start? Who starts them and why?</p>
<p>Why do you think so many countries became embroiled in these wars at the same time?</p>
<p>This was not a coincidence.</p>
<p>There is a plan being organised by the antichrist to control and conquer these nations who have rich resources.</p>
<p>Once they control these countries they will become very powerful.</p>
<p>As these wars increase and become wearisome, then the antichrist will make himself known, as the peaceful negotiator.</p>
<p>Few of you are being told the Truth, because of the control that the antichrist and his organisations hold, in the world of communications.</p>
<p>Pray now, as the wars will increase, so as to render their plans impotent.</p>
<p>Know that Israel, so influenced by the West, will be rejected and betrayed by the US, when they least expect it.</p>
<p>It will be then that the holocaust I speak of will take place.</p>
<p>Pray, pray, pray for the people of Israel, who will continue to suffer for their sins, until My Second Coming.</p>
<p>Your beloved Jesus</p>
