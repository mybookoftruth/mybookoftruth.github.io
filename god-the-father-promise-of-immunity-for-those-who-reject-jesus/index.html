		<p>My precious daughter, thank you for responding to this important calling from the Heavenly Realm when I asked you to accept the Mystical Union with My precious Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I Am Present in My Son, Jesus, as He is in Me, united with the Love of the Holy Spirit. Your soul, therefore, is now entwined with Mine and everything will become much clearer to you.</p>
<p>My child, you are being moulded into the creature I so desire, so that you will be made worthy in full for this Divine Mission. Tears of Divine intervention were given to you so you could recognize instantly this new, unexpected calling. Now that you have shed your tears, cry no more for only happiness will reign in your soul from now on.</p>
<p>My daughter, it saddens Me that no one recognizes Me any more in the world. Many have forgotten Me completely. I mean nothing to so many of My children.</p>
<p>You must help Me, daughter, when I manifest My Presence, so that I Am recognized through prayer.</p>
<p>Please pray that the whole of humanity will accept the Gift of New Life, which will now be given to them by My beloved Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>No one truly understands My concern for those souls who reject Me or the Existence of the Saviour I sent into the world.</p>
<p>These poor souls, so full of logical explanations used to arrogantly dismiss My Existence, are lost to Me at this time. Their only salvation – as many will reject the offer of <a href="/divine-mercy-chaplet/">Divine Mercy</a> during The Warning – will be through the prayer of those children who love the Father.</p>
<p>So many, who do not accept Me, still know very little about Me. I Am a God of Paternal Love, a heavenly Father Who watches over each child of Mine, the strong, the weak, the sick, the good and the wicked. No one is excluded from My infinite Love, no matter how black their soul is.</p>
<p>I urge you, children, to pray to Me in the Name of My Son, in atonement for all the sins of mankind.</p>
<p>My Son will envelop the whole of humanity now and when the Illumination of Conscience is past your prayers are truly needed at that stage. Your prayers, children, will help save those people who will defiantly continue to reject the Mercy My Son will show them.</p>
<p>My solemn promise, children, is that all those of you who call on Me, on behalf of My beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to save your brothers and sisters, that they will be granted immediate immunity. Special graces will be given to each of you who pledges a full month of prayer for their souls. Here is what I request you to say:</p>
<p><strong>“O heavenly Father, through the Love of your beloved Son, Jesus Christ whose Passion on the Cross saved us from sin, please save all those who still reject His Hand of Mercy. Flood their souls, dear Father, with Your token of Love. I plead with You heavenly Father, hear my prayer and save these souls from eternal damnation. Through Your Mercy allow them to be the first to enter the New Era of Peace on Earth. Amen.”</strong></p>
<p>Your heavenly Father<br>
God the Most High</p>
<p>(Note of Clarification: the immunity will be granted to those for whom you
