		<p>My dearly beloved daughter,<strong> every visionary, seer or prophet, who comes from Me, will soon face great trials, the likes of which they have never had to endure before.</strong> <strong>Many, who recognize their authenticity and who have been loyal to them, will turn their backs on them and they will be cast to one side, as the spirit of darkness envelops nation after nation, where love and charity will disappear.</strong> Man against man, country against country, man against God.</p>
<p>These periods of upheaval will be distressing for many and your only source of comfort and strength will come from Me, but only if you seek Me out.<strong> I Am your Rock; the Rock which is impenetrable; the Rock which cannot crumble; the Rock which you will embrace when nothing solid will be in place in the houses which give shelter to My Spirit.</strong> Edifices, which have been built to honour Me, will come tumbling down. Some will be turned into other buildings, which will be used for other purposes, but not for honouring Me.</p>
<p><strong>I Am the Rock upon which the Church was built and I will remain in place for eternity.</strong> Many have come seeking Me out and I gave them Life. Others came, but could not find Me because their stubborn hearts were lacking in love and a generosity of spirit. And now, <strong>as everything I taught you will be challenged and the foundation upon which My Church was built be shaken, beyond your understanding, I will still remain in place. Solid as the Rock that I Am,</strong> and you will come to Me seeking solace, strength and courage. <strong>I will respond to each of you, by the pouring out of the great Graces, which have been reserved for you, for the times which lie ahead.</strong> I Am the Church. I Am Present in the Church. The building is made of stone, but I Am the Rock, upon which the foundation of My Church was built. I never change. I never adapt to new ways, for I Am as I always Was and will Be. I Am Eternal.</p>
<p>My Church will remain standing, for I Am the Church, until the end of time.</p>
<p>Your beloved Jesus</p>
