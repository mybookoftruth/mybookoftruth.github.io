		<p>My dearly beloved daughter the torment inflicted on you by those lacking in true humility, but who profess to speak in My Name, will intensify now.</p>
<p>Listen to no voice only Mine.Do not engage or respond to those who insult Me.</p>
<p><strong>They have allowed human pride to block Me and then, not only is that not enough, they persecute Me.</strong></p>
<p>My Second Coming will be similar to events which took place during My time on earth the first time.</p>
<p>My Holy Word will be questioned, criticised, dismissed and then rejected.</p>
<p>T<strong>he first to reject Me will be My own, those souls who love Me the most. They will stand front in line to throw the first stone.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>My Agony in the Garden is being relived once again and I am doubled with the pain of suffering.</p>
<p>I agonised over the sins of mankind, not only those who lived at that time, but those who reject Me today. Those who reject Me today hurt Me more because I died for their sins. They have learnt nothing.</p>
<p>T<strong>hen those who mocked Me and tore My eye out with the thorn, the sharpest one in the Crown of Thorns, are those representatives of My Church on Earth.</strong></p>
<p>They won’t accept My Second Coming or the warnings I reveal to them now.</p>
<p>Every word uttered from My lips is being devoured by those humble souls like children in a famine.</p>
<p><strong>Yet those nourished by the knowledge of the Truth of My Teachings, turn their heads and look the other way.</strong></p>
<p>Humility is no longer present in the souls of many of My followers so that they will be unable to benefit from My special Graces.</p>
<p><strong>Until you become little in the eyes of God you cannot hear Me.</strong></p>
<p>Until you denounce pride and arrogance you will not feel the power of the Holy Spirit.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>When you reject Me today you plunge the first nail into My wrist. </strong></p>
<p>When you, My sacred servants, denounce My Holy Word, given to you now, <strong>you drive the second nail into My other wrist.</strong></p>
<p>For those poor souls who have no interest in My Teachings or the Salvation I gave the world, through My Death on the Cross, they have no one to guide them.</p>
<p><strong>They are the victims here. They are not being led towards Me. They are being denied the chance to prepare for My Second Coming.</strong></p>
<p>Now I call all of My followers to prepare.The battle among believers will begin soon. One half will not only denounce these messages, they will try to ban them.</p>
<p>The other half will use them to convert others.</p>
<p><strong>Those simple lost souls who don’t know Me at all, will know Me as soon as I reveal the Truth to them during The Warning.</strong></p>
<p>It will be easier for them to see the Truth than it will for those who say they love Me but who deny Me now.</p>
<p>This is why  you need to pray for the graces to allow you to see Me, hear Me and to let Me prepare you for My Second Coming.</p>
<p>Never believe that to  truly follow Me, especially in these the End Times, will be easy.</p>
<p><strong>For this time, silent homage to My Holy Word, will not be enough.</strong></p>
<p>You will be like a new recruit in any army. You will need to train, renew your souls and come to Me through the Sacraments, before you will be strong enough and brave enough to spread My Holy Word.</p>
<p>The spread of My Crusade Prayers will be your first task.</p>
<p>You, My army will lead the biggest Crusade of My Holy Mission on earth ever. You will start small but will swell to 20 million.</p>
<p>The prayers and suffering of My Remnant Church can be enough to save the whole of humanity. Never forget that your prayers can save the souls of the most grievous sinners so powerful is prayer. So prepare to gather together. Prepare well because efforts will be made to stop you.Accept the abusive insults which will be flung at you.</p>
<p><strong>Know that every kind of argument will be presented to you in order to stop you in your mission.But know that I guide you, steer you and make you strong.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Know also that you, My Army, will be responsible for the salvation of millions of souls. Souls who would have had no hope at all.</strong></p>
<p>Let My love touch your soul and bind you together as one, in union with Me, your Jesus.</p>
<p>Allow Me to cover you with My Precious Blood and bestow My Gifts to help you stay loyal to Me so that, no matter how strong the temptation is, you never deny My call to you now.</p>
<p>I bless you all My strong Army.</p>
<p><strong>I will lead you in your march to the New Era of Peace every step of the way.</strong></p>
<p>Your beloved Saviour</p>
<p>Redeemer of Mankind</p>
