		<p>My dear children, God created the universe in all its perfection. As this comes from God, everything has a precise and natural order according to the Holy Will of God.</p>
<p>The laws of man and the laws of nature were created by He Who is above all things. This is why all things that were meant to be must remain as they are. God created a natural order for humanity; a place to live; food to eat and the Gift of free will. Everything that is natural comes from God. God created this order so that man could survive. When the natural order of the universe – the  food that you eat, the water you drink and the natural reproduction of the human race – is interfered with by man, then all vengeance will belong to God.</p>
<p>So many have tried to change the order of the world, which was created by God for the human race. They will suffer for this, because God will abandon those who exchanged the Truth of His Creation for false substitutes. If man continues to serve his own self-interests, then God will allow him to degrade himself by permitting him to exchange all that is natural for everything that is unnatural.</p>
<p>It is because of the influence of Satan that man has changed the Laws of God and this will bring  destruction. Everything, which comes from God, is not considered to be good enough and man will try to change the rules of nature to suit his sinful lusts. He will go so far as to try to deny the Creation of the universe by making false claims as to its origin. Everything began with God and all will end with God. All good things will come to an end for the man who rises up in defiance against God. Once the Laws of Creation are tampered with, a great chastisement on earth will be witnessed. While God is Patient, He will never allow man to dictate how He rules His Kingdom.</p>
<p><b>When man degrades himself to such lowly levels and no longer respects life; the human body; his fellow brothers and sisters or the Laws of God, powerful storms will emerge, in great numbers, lasting weeks. The roar of these storms will be felt in many nations. When you witness these, know the Wrath of God will have descended and </b><b>that man is being penalized for the great blasphemies he has committed against his Creator.</b></p>

<p>Your Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
