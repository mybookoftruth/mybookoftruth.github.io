		<p>My dearly beloved daughter the earth is about to shake as My Father’s anger will spill over those nations who defy My Father’s Laws.</p>
<p>No mercy will be shown as His patience has been tested to the limits.</p>
<p><strong>Their sins include abortion, murder, laws which try to undermine Christianity, same sex marriage and the adoration of false gods.</strong></p>
<p>Then there are those dissidents within My Church who threaten to disown Me.</p>
<p>When they try to distance themselves from My Church, and try to create new laws in defiance of My Holy Will, they disown Me.</p>
<p>I cast them out now for their disloyalty. Their  attempts to introduce laws, based on the sin of pride, lust and worldly ambition, will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Did they think they would be allowed to distance God’s children from My Church on earth and avoid the Hand of My Father?</p>
<p><strong>Did they think that they were above the Laws of God?</strong></p>
<p>They do not love God, they love themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Lacking in humility their public rejection of the Laws of the Catholic Church disgust Me</strong>.</p>
<p>Their shameful demands where they try to force My Church to accept laws, which offend Me, means they have cast themselves into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>Their religious vows are meaningless.</strong></p>
<p>Their pledge to honour and obey My Church has been broken.</p>
<p>Unless they repent and come back to My Body, My Church on earth, they have no right to call themselves servants in My Church.</p>
<p>You have been warned. I will cast you into the wilderness.</p>
<p>Desecrate the Laws of My church and you will be punished.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
