		<p>My child, your suffering, along with other chosen souls, will intensify during Holy Week.</p>
<p>This is the week where the deceiver will hurt as many of God’s children as he can, through wars, persecution and violence.</p>
<p>It is at this time that he inflicts great suffering just as my precious Son endured during His Passion on the Cross.</p>
<p><strong>My child, you must tell all those who have encouraged souls everywhere to recite my <a href="/how-to-pray-the-rosary/">Holy Rosary</a> every Friday up to Easter, that I am most pleased.</strong></p>
<p>The souls they are saving, along with the suffering of their own nations, are all being helped through these devotions.</p>
<p>The Love of my Son is being felt now by more people all over the world, at a time of great suffering.</p>
<p>He eases their pain with His special Graces and soothes their souls, by the Power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Children, your prayers, which are so lovingly presented by you in the Heavens, are being heard.</strong></p>
<p>You must seek the help of my Son and my Eternal Father, at all times. Every single prayer, no matter how small, is heard and answered, according to the Will of God Most High.</p>
<p><strong>My child, ask my children to do one day of fasting, on Good Friday, to prevent the one world currency from being introduced.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your prayers and fasting can do this.<strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>As soon as this prayer is said during your fast, my Eternal Father will stop these people from inflicting the austerity they are planning so that they can control you.</p>
<p>These same people want to abolish Christianity, so it is important that you stop this from happening through special sacrifices.</p>
<p><strong>Crusade Prayer (42) Prayer of fasting to stop One World Currency</strong></p>
<p><i>“O God Most High, I offer you my gift of fasting, so that You will stop the grip of evil in the world, being planned to starve my country of food, including the Bread of Life.</i></p>
<p>Accept my offering and listen to my pleas for other nations to prevent them from the suffering being planned by the antichrist.</p>
<p>Save us, dear Lord, from this wickedness and protect our Faith, so that we can honour You with the freedom we need to love and adore You forever and ever. Amen.”</p>
<p>My child, one day of fasting, on Good Friday, will bring much freedom to nations, from the evil one and those who follow his wicked desires to control the finances of all nations.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
<p>Mother of God</p>
