		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, there is a plan to commence a surge of global preaching.</p>
<p>This preaching will not be of God. Instead, it will preach a lie, which will state, that God does not, and cannot, exist.</p>
<p><strong>They will say, using human reasoning and scientific evaluation, that God is just a figment of man’s imagination.</strong></p>
<p>This preaching is no accident, for it is a well-planned and coordinated campaign plotted by these atheists  whose allegiance is to the evil one.</p>
<p>Their hearts, minds and souls have been stolen by Satan, who uses their pride of human intellect to arrogantly proclaim lies to block the Truth.</p>
<p>This is a plan to turn the hearts of people everywhere to stone, just as their own hearts are cold and unloving. Then there will be an announcement that a new substitute religion will be introduced into law.</p>
<p>The one world religion will pay homage to the beast, because it will be by the hand of slaves to the king of darkness that this atrocity will come about.</p>
<p><strong>The atheists who will mastermind this plan are devout followers of Satan. </strong></p>
<p>Make no mistake – they idolise the beast and think nothing of the hurt and torment which their actions will bring about.</p>
<p>Their mission is to abolish allegiance to the one True God, the God who loves every one of the children He created. They will reject the efforts now being made from Heaven to save humanity from final destruction.</p>
<p><strong>It will be by their hand that lightning, earthquakes and tsunamis will strike the earth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>They will be stopped. </strong></p>
<p><strong>They will suffer terribly and their agonising end has been foretold. </strong></p>
<p>The Battle of Armageddon will be fierce, for God will no longer sit back and allow such infestation.</p>
<p><strong>Terrible chastisements, of such magnitude, will wipe out those heathen who reject the Word of God.</strong></p>
<p>Prayer to God seeking Mercy is the only way to mitigate such chastisements.</p>
<p>Your prayers, begging for the forgiveness of their sins, is the only way in which such souls can be saved.</p>
<p>My daughter, much destruction will result because of the wicked work, which these atheists groups intend to force upon the earth.</p>
<p>Many do not know the seriousness of their actions.</p>
<p>Many, however, do know exactly what they are doing, for they are liars.</p>
<p>They do believe in God, for they have chosen His nemesis, the devil, as their god by their own free choice.</p>
<p>All they want is to steal souls.</p>
<p>God My Father will, by His Power, intervene not merely to punish them, but to salvage souls before they are stolen from Him.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
