		<p>My dearly beloved daughter let no man underestimate the impact that The Warning will have on the whole of humanity.</p>
<p>The Warning for many will be a frightening event, when it will seem like the world has come to an end.</p>
<p>Many will witness what will seen to be a catastrophic occurrence when two comets will appear to collide and explode close to the earth’s surface.</p>
<p><strong>The flames of fire will seem as if a volcano has erupted in the skies and many will be fearful</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The rays of red fire are the Rays of My Blood, the Rays of My Mercy, given to all of you as a gift of such magnitude that no man will be able to comprehend what is happening.</strong></p>
<p>Many will feel a fire burning through their bodies as if the heat of the sun is overpowering them.</p>
<p>Inside they will feel a burning heat, until the sense of realisation enables them to witness the spectacle of their souls.</p>
<p><strong>Many will feel the earth shake as if there is an earthquake. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The ground will shake, groan and many will fall down clutching whatever they can for shelter.</strong></p>
<p>Yet the ground will not open up and swallow them. For this is not a physical earthquake but a supernatural one.<br>
</p>
<p>Before this happens the weather patterns will erupt.</p>
<p><strong>My Cross will appear after the explosion in the skies. </strong></p>
<p>Many will weep bitter tears of remorse and sadness and will endure the pain of humiliation because of their sins.</p>
<p>Others will scream and curse because they will not be able to withstand the illumination, a divine sign, because of the darkness of their souls and they will resist the light of My Mercy.</p>
<p>They will howl with the pain of the fires of Hell as My Sign of Mercy will show them the fate which awaits them, unless they repent and change their ways.</p>
<p>Those good souls who love Me will also suffer for many of them will be also be stained with sin but they will receive instant Absolution. They too, will be humbled, when their sin of pride is shown to them.</p>
<p><strong>Many will stay indoors for some days afterwards and many will have to fend for themselves because of the lack of services. This is why you need to prepare.</strong></p>
<p>It will also be a period of suffering when souls will endure the pain of Purgatory as their purification takes place. In this way many will experience a revelation of the state of their souls and become humbled in a way in which they have never experienced before.</p>
<p>So many people will accept what has happened and will know that they have been given a great Gift of My Graces and My Divine Mercy.</p>
<p><strong>The conversion will be global and on a scale not witnessed since My Death on the Cross.</strong><br>
<strong><br>
Billions will turn to God because the Truth will become apparent.</strong></p>
<p>They will know exactly what will happen on the <strong>Day of Judgement</strong> and they will know how to save their souls because My Love will have enveloped them.</p>
<p>They can become whole again of mind, body and soul.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p>My Cross will be the proof of My manifestation of My Divine Mercy promised to mankind for so long. It will be seen in the skies all over the world.</p>
<p>A calmness will descend throughout the earth as a result of this act of divine intervention given to God’s children to awake them from their slumber.</p>
<p>But the fallen angels will attack all God’s children through their dedicated army who will refuse My Cup of Salvation.</p>
<p>So bitter, with hearts of stone and infested with the stain of Satan, they will fight those who love God.</p>
<p>Their numbers will not be a match for those who follow the Truth, yet their hatred will inspire them to plot evil acts which will destroy this peace and calm.</p>
<p>This will orchestrate a plan to convince the world that this event was, indeed, a cosmic accident which they will say that scientists can prove.  Many, sadly, will then believe this to be the case and many of God’s children will fall back to the old sinful lives they once led.</p>
<p>The battle for souls will then commence and it will take some time for this to reach the final confrontation when My Second Coming will bring to an end the wickedness.</p>
<p>My dear followers do not allow these revelations to bring fear.</p>
<p>Instead prepare for this glorious event and allow your souls to embrace it.</p>
<p>Accept this wonderful Divine Act to strengthen your resolve and to spread My love further amongst your family and friends.</p>
<p>Be proud of  your ties to Me, your Jesus, and help Me salvage those souls who will refuse to accept My Mercy.</p>
<p>Go. Prepare. Rejoice for the time is close.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
