		<p>My dearly beloved daughter when you suffer because of Me, and when you feel isolated and beyond Me, know that this is when you are closest to My Sacred Heart.</p>
<p><strong>Although this, My Book of Truth, is a Gift to the world from Me and is protected from Heaven, it does not mean that this journey will not be painful for you.</strong></p>
<p>You will experience a criticism and a new kind of attack now that My Holy Word is printed for the world to share.</p>
<p><strong>You must never respond to those who demand that you explain why this book was necessary. Remain silent and continue with My Work.</strong></p>
<p>Do not let any one stop or delay the spread of My Book for every day counts as there is limited time for souls to be granted the time to redeem themselves in My Eyes.</p>
<p>Let me assure you, My daughter, and all of My followers, that you are now setting out on a journey, a pilgrimage, like no other.</p>
<p>This time is likened to the calm before the storm.</p>
<p><strong>Use it to prepare as many people as possible. Spread My messages, My Crusade Prayers, and pray for your brothers and sisters so that after The Warning they will accept My Mercy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gather My Church together and pray for strength for the False Prophet is preparing and is already present in the Vatican. But he hides his true façade very carefully. My beloved Vicar is being isolated and time is short.</strong></p>
<p>I want all of you to begin a new Litany of Prayers for protection against the False Prophet and recite them once a day from now on.</p>
<p>The Crusade Prayers may be selected in different lots and recited as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Here is the first Jesus to Mankind Litany Prayer (1) Protection against the False Prophet</strong></p>
<p>Dearest Jesus save us from the deceit of the False Prophet.</p>
<p>Jesus have Mercy on us.</p>
<p>Jesus save us from the persecution.</p>
<p>Jesus preserve us from the antichrist.</p>
<p>Lord have Mercy.</p>
<p>Christ have Mercy.</p>
<p>Dearest Jesus, cover us with Your Precious Blood.</p>
<p>Dearest Jesus, open our eyes to the lies of the False Prophet.</p>
<p>Dearest Jesus unite Your Church.</p>
<p>Jesus protect our Sacraments.</p>
<p>Jesus don’t let the False Prophet divide Your Church.</p>
<p>Dearest Jesus help us to reject lies presented to us as the truth.</p>
<p>Jesus give us strength.</p>
<p>Jesus give us hope.</p>
<p>Jesus flood our souls with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Jesus protect us from the Beast.</p>
<p>Jesus give us the gift of discernment so we can follow</p>
<p>the path of Your True Church at all times forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>My daughter, please do not feel overwhelmed with this Mission for I will send you help soon. You must accept all that I ask of you and remain strong in the confidence that all is well.</p>
<p>The conversion is already obtained through these messages and amounts to hundreds of thousands of souls already. So do not feel helpless or worried. I am pleased with the loyalty and dedication of those who love Me without condition.</p>
<p>I am sending you those of Mine with pure hearts to offer you protection.</p>
<p>They will lift you and help you to lead My followers on the entire journey to the Gates of the New Paradise.</p>
<p>I love you My beloved followers. Persevere with Me on this thorny path. Accept the ridicule you will have to face as you continue to spread My Holy Word.</p>
<p>Know that I am always with each one of you. I know My own and they know Me. Nothing can separate us.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
