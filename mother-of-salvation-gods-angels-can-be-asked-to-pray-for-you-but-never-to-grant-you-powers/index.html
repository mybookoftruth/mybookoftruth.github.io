		<p>My dear children, you must never pray to God’s angels, for they are His servants and strive only to give Glory to God and to do His most Holy Will. Prayer is an act of worship and when you call on God’s angels, within His Heavenly Hierarchy, it must always be with the intention of asking them to pray for you. If you try to communicate with the Heavenly Hierarchy of Angels, then it must only be to ask for their assistance and guidance so that you can do God’s Most Holy Will.</p>
<p><strong>To those of you who believe that you will receive powers from God’s Angels then you are mistaken. The power given to angels can come only from God and you must never use them as a substitute for praying to Him. So many souls try to communicate with angels today for selfish reasons and to obtain powers that have nothing to do with God. An obsession with angels can lead to a terrible discontent because this can attract the spirit of evil if you are not careful.</strong></p>
<p>When calling on God’s angels to help you, you must always bless yourself first with Holy Water and then ask them for assistance, in the name of Jesus Christ. If you do not do this and use any object, which is not associated with Christianity, when calling on angels for their help, then this could invite the spirit of evil into your life. Once this happens you will find it almost impossible to eradicate it.</p>
<p>A pre-occupation with communicating with angels can lead to dabbling in the occult. Once this happens, you will attract those angels who were cast out of Heaven by My Heavenly Father. They now roam the earth in the hundreds of thousands, seeking a home. Souls who leave themselves open to their influence can quickly become entangled in a spiritual world that is not of God.  Once you embrace the underworld you will have no peace.   These fallen angels will entice you into a web of deceit. First of all you will feel a sense of hope and then a belief that you can control all aspects of your life, with the help of such angels. Eventually you will, mistakenly, believe that you are in full control of your own destiny. Every false notion of peace will fill your minds but, soon afterwards, you will feel a terrible wretchedness.</p>
<p><strong>Dabbling with such spirits that you believe to be angels of God, but who do not belong in His Kingdom, will lead you into engaging with the occult, which will blind you to the Truth and destroy your soul.</strong></p>
<p><strong>God does not grant His Angels permission to give you gifts because these can only come from Him. God’s Angels can be asked to pray for you but never to grant you worldly goods or spiritual powers. When you idolize angels and seek out these things you are guilty of breaking the First Commandment of God.</strong></p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
