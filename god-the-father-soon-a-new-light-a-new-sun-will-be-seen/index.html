		<p>My dearest daughter, this is a Message of great hope for all My children.</p>
<p><strong>The time for the changes, as foretold, when the earth will turn; the planets will change and the climates will no longer be predictable, is upon you.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>My Great Power is now being manifested in Heaven, as it is on earth, as I lead the battle against My enemies. Satan and his demons are being defeated, but they put up a terrible defence. With them, they suck My poor children, whose hearts are filled with political and worldly ambitions, into playing a role, as they try to crucify My children.</p>
<p>Man is weak. Man is easily seduced. Because of his blindness to the Truth, laid down by Me, from the beginning of Creation, man believes in lies. He believes the lies, spewed out by the evil one, because he is attracted by the promises of power and pleasure.</p>
<p>My children must acknowledge the glorious and splendid Light of My Kingdom. You, My daughter, have seen this Light and you know how powerful it is. You know the Power of God, and how it envelops you. Can you imagine what this will be like when My New Paradise is revealed? You, My daughter, have glimpsed but just a small portion of this glorious and gleaming Light.</p>
<p>It is important to welcome the Light of My Son into your hearts. When you invite Him to salvage you, and take you into His Sacred Heart, you will feel this Light.</p>
<p><strong>The Light of the New Dawn – the New Era – will slowly, but surely, illuminate the world. Soon, a new Light, a new sun, will be seen. It will be larger and will be the cause of much wonder. </strong></p>
<p>This is a sign of My Power and My Majesty. It will be a miracle and will prove that man does not fully understand the secret of Creation.</p>
<p><strong>Only I, God the Creator of the Universe, command all that is. All that will be. All that can be. No man, no scientist, can solve these most sacred secrets, as it is not for man to understand at this time.</strong></p>
<p>The wonders of My Creation, and the force of My Power, will be shown to the world. Let no man make the error of believing that Satan, and his wicked followers, have any power to bring you the wonders which I have Created for every single creature. I have promised to reveal the Truth so that you, My children, can wipe away the cobwebs which cover your eyes.</p>
<p>When the Day comes for the Truth to be finally accepted by you, I will grant you the most splendid riches, graces and a life you could never envisage, for it is beyond your imagination.</p>
<p>I am happy to impart this Message of hope today. I hope it brings you much happiness and peace.</p>
<p>My Promise, to bring you to your final inheritance, is to become a reality, soon.</p>
<p>Your Loving Father<br>
God the Most High</p>
