		<p>My dearest daughter, <strong>My Time has come to intervene, forcibly, in the world, at a time of great sin against Me. </strong></p>
<p>My Patience is tested and My Anger has been stirred as I witness the greatest insults, which are being perpetrated against Me.</p>
<p><strong>As the Creator of all living things, I Am the Author of life. I Create it as I desire and I end it according to My Holy Will.</strong> It is when man tries to interfere with My Will, that I will strike back, for I will not tolerate such wickedness.</p>
<p>To those who kill any of My children, your life will be ended. I will take your life, not only in body, but in spirit. No eternal life will, nor can be granted to you. The life you take away will be your downfall. An eye for an eye will be your punishment.</p>
<p>Heed, those of you who continue to destroy life in every form. I know what you are doing. I know that the plan of abortion around the world is controlled by one group amongst you. I know that those countries, who rush through obscene legislation to justify abortion, are mere puppets. They are held by strings as they dance to the tune of the One World Group, who obey only one master.  Their allegiance is to the beast, whose greatest plan, to destroy hundreds of millions of lives, has been succeeding, through the sin of abortion. The unborn are an easy target in their eyes. They use abortion to interfere with My Laws and the great Gift I bequeathed to man – the Gift of life.</p>
<p>The arrogance of man, joined at the hip to the beast and those amongst you he fools, sickens Me. My Love is Powerful, but your wicked intent, to destroy what is Mine, will be brought to such an abrupt halt, that you will scream for your life. Unless you call on Me now through the Gift of Reconciliation, you will be shown little Mercy. For each of you who condones, promotes or takes any part in, the taking of the life of the unborn, you will suffer the same punishment. Destroy those innocent lives and your own lives will be taken. I have watched, in terrible pain, how you have been insulting Me, for so long. Your time is over, for you will be severely punished now, for this grave act against My Divinity.</p>
<p>Remember, there is little time for you to abandon your acceptance of abortion. <strong>My Wrath will soon pour over the four corners of the Earth. It is because of the sin of abortion, that man will suffer the worst chastisement.</strong> Not one country will be excluded from these punishments. Only those who do not permit abortion will be spared the terrible pain I will inflict upon the world.</p>
<p>As the Author of life, no man has the right to go against Me. No one. He that dares defy Me, by imitating Me in the taking of life, will be deprived of all life.</p>
<p>Your Father</p>
<p>God the Most High</p>
