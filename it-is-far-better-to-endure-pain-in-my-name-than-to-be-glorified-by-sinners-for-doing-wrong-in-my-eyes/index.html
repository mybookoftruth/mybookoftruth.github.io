		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, let no man be ashamed of the persecution he may face because he defends Me as a Christian. You must never fear persecution in My Holy Name, because when you find that you are criticised for speaking the Truth, know then that you are a true servant of Mine. </p>
<p>Only those who are in Me and with Me suffer ridicule or hatred in My Name. Those of you who are truly Mine and when you surrender your will so that it becomes Mine will suffer the most. Y<strong>ou must always understand that when hatred against any beloved follower of Mine is at its most intense, you can be sure that this is where My Presence is strongest.</strong> It is far better to endure pain in My Name than to be glorified by sinners for doing wrong in My Eyes.</p>
<p>Dearest followers of Mine, <strong>let Me reassure you that My Hand is guiding you every day in this, My last Mission on Earth.</strong> <strong>My Word will stir your souls and the souls of all those billions who will follow you – for soon the world will hear My Voice.</strong> Let no obstacle stand in your way when you speak of Me; when you remind people of My Teachings and when you remind My holy servants of their obligation to remain true to My Word, contained in the Holy Gospels.</p>
<p>When you are asked to denounce Me, whether through the Holy Eucharist or through an altered version of the Holy Bible, you must refuse to do this, openly and without shame. You must defend the Word by refusing to accept lies in My Name. <strong>In order to protect you from the persecutors, who will inflict outrages against My Church and all those who remain true to the Word of God, please recite this Crusade Prayer. </strong></p>
<p><b>Crusade Prayer (141)</b> <b>Protection against persecution</b></p>
<p><strong><i>Dear Jesus, defend me in my battle to remain true to Your Word at any cost. Safeguard me against Your enemies. Protect me from those who persecute me because of You. </i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Share in my pain. Ease my suffering. Raise me in the Light of Your Face, until the Day You come again to bring Eternal Salvation to the world.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Forgive those who persecute me. Use my suffering to atone for their sins, so they can find peace in their hearts and welcome You with remorse in their souls on the last Day. Amen.</i></strong></p>
<p>Go and take comfort in the hope that I will take all My enemies and those who persecute any of you in My Name into the Refuge of My Great Mercy.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
