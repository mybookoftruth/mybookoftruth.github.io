		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, the evil spirit of Jezebel has planned a great assault against My Mission to salvage souls.</p>
<p>This traitor and destroyer of God’s prophets, has established herself on earth as God’s teacher, and manifested amongst My people, to seduce them and lead them away from My Church, in what will be the greatest apostasy of all time. She will be responsible for My Church committing adultery with the princes of a secular world that will bring about a union, which is abhorrent to God and an abomination in His Eyes.</p>
<p>Present, both in the hearts of men and women alike, Jezebel is one of the most evil, intelligent and cunning demons in Satan’s hierarchy and works in many ways to mislead My people. She works through a group, who claim to be of Me, but who are involved with a satanic cult. Well versed in theology, this demonic spirit speaks to this group using different languages and causes great confusion, hurt and division, among those who have accepted My Cup. These self-appointed experts of My Word do not come from Me. And, while their hatred of Me is evident, by the filth that pours out of their mouths, there are other ways in which they will try to harm My final Mission.</p>
<p>You will recognise this enemy of God by constant attempts to declare her followers to be prophets of God. Many of them will come forward and declare that I, Jesus Christ, speak through them. Jezebel will flourish and breed lies by attaching her wicked and arrogant spirit to self-appointed prophets, who will then try to use this Mission to give their voices legitimacy.</p>
<p>The evil spirit of Jezebel will do all she can to infiltrate My Church on earth, using every conceivable tactic. Through her influence, she will lead many good souls away from Me, in My Church, and undermine the Word of God. Working amongst men and women, she will use sorcery and witchcraft, to create the impression of miracles. This is yet another adversary of Mine, who, under the influence of Baal, will try to harm God’s genuine visionaries and prophets in the final battle for souls.</p>
<p><strong>Beware of those who boast of their knowledge of theology and who dare to say they come from Me when all that they speak springs from jealousy and an intense hatred of God’s prophets. Such infested souls will try to manipulate you and intimidate anyone who opposes them. If you continue to follow My final mission on earth, to salvage souls, they will do all they can to wear you down.</strong></p>
<p>Those who are influenced by the spirit of Jezebel will work, relentlessly, to attack Me. This wicked spirit, through the weak souls she captures, will use demonic means to slander, belittle and incite hatred against those who follow Me. Run, when you are confronted by these infested souls. Do not underestimate them, because under the influence of Jezebel, they will try to cause unimaginable harm to those who engage with them.</p>
<p>Learn to recognise the evil spirit of Jezebel, because she will speak with great authority about Me, through those she possesses.  They will speak with an in-depth knowledge of the Holy Sacraments and use extracts from the Holy Bible, but only so they can misquote them to undermine My Word.  You will see Jezebel attack this Mission with spiteful relish. Her devoted followers are stubborn, domineering, full of pride and deeply committed to this adversary of Mine, who has seized their souls under her powerful influence. You must never engage with the spirit of Jezebel, because if you do, she will destroy you, just as she has done those cohorts of hers.</p>
<p><b>Be wary of anyone who comes forward and who says they have been sent by Me, to help spread My Word. Know that I have not appointed one single prophet to communicate My Word to the world since this Mission began</b>. <b>But out they will come, these false prophets, in their droves, each one trying to outdo the other. They will then try to use this mission to garner support, so that they can spread untruths. </b>All those who may be seduced by the evil spirit of Jezebel, and who respond in any way to this spirit, will soon find that all love for Me will come to an abrupt end.  <b>You place your soul in great danger when you fall for the lies of Jezebel, sent from the bowels of the abyss to destroy My Church and My prophets in these times.</b></p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
