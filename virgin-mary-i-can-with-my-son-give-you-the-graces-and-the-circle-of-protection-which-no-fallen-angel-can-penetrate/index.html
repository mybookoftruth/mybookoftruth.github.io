		<p>My child how my Son suffers at this time and how my own suffering is entwined with His.</p>
<p><strong>Those who cause suffering to others crucify my Son.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When they do terrible things which cause hardship, pain and death to God’s children they re-create the Passion of my Son.</strong></p>
<p>Those who follow the path of the deceiver are being tempted every second by the fallen angels led by Satan.</p>
<p>Many of them do not know this so you must pray for them.</p>
<p>Many of them do not realise that they are being used by the evil one to achieve his destruction of the human race.</p>
<p>Very soon they will be discarded by Satan when they serve no further purpose.</p>
<p><strong>My Son will be waiting to welcome such sinners back into His Sacred Arms so merciful is He.</strong></p>
<p>The wicked plans being perpetrated by Satan, invisible to all, are to bring about grief to my Eternal Father. By hurting their brothers and sisters, those hardened sinners, hurt God.</p>
<p>Never think that they will achieve all that they set out to do.</p>
<p>I, the Mother of God, as Co-Redemptrix and Mediatrix have been given the graces to destroy the serpent.<br>
<strong><br>
By asking me to help you I can offer you protection children from fear. </strong></p>
<p>I can, with my son, give you the graces and the circle of protection which no fallen angel can penetrate.</p>
<p>Satan cannot harm or attack all those who say my Holy Rosary every day.</p>
<p>By reciting three or more Rosaries you can extend this protection for others. If even a hundred people could do this they could save their nation from the contamination spread by the evil one.</p>
<p>You must gather together children and pray to protect yourselves.</p>
<p>You must be generous of heart and pray for your enemies for many of them do not realise what they are doing.</p>
<p>By trusting in my Son completely and accepting the gifts He now brings you through His teachings and prophecies you can wipe out all your fears.</p>
<p><strong>Satan preys and feeds on fear. Face the Truth and use prayer to mitigate the evil plans underway by those evil groups who want to destroy humanity.</strong></p>
<p>Feel the love of my Son by opening your hearts. Hand me, the Mother of Salvation, your worries and I will take them to my Son.</p>
<p>Then I will cover you with my most holy mantle and you will feel a strength which can only come from Heaven.</p>
<p>Only then will you be filled with peace, courage and the determination to become part of God’s army. This army, already forming, is made up of the multitudes across every nation.</p>
<p>They will march to the end and cannot be defeated.</p>
<p>Thank you my child for responding to my call.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
