		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, don’t you know that, as more of you follow My Messages, you will be tormented by those who wish to silence My Voice?</p>
<p><strong>As this Mission continues, by the Command of My beloved Father, every effort will be made by those, especially in My Church on Earth who oppose these Holy Messages, to force you to stop following them.</strong> These objections will increase and every kind of twisted logic, arrogant denial of the Truth and falsified theology, will be used to drown out the Voice of God.</p>
<p>The more you are hated, My disciples, the more you are loved by God, because only those who follow Me and live their lives according to My Teachings will suffer in this way. <strong>If you are exalted, favoured and chosen by the world as a living saint, where no fault is found or the error of your ways publicly identified, then you are not chosen by God, for you defy what is expected of God’s servants. Without expressing the Truth and by twisting My Truth, in order to excel yourselves in the eyes of the world, you will be thrown to one side while I seek out My true servants. </strong></p>
<p>My true servants love Me and are moved by My Holy Spirit. Their sorrow, which is expressed in their eyes, because they suffer with Me, can be seen clearly by those who have been given the Gift of the Holy Spirit themselves. Never do these pure souls condemn others or try to block the Word of God, for they are incapable of doing this.</p>
<p>You must pray hard at this time – all of you – for these holy servants of Mine are under attack because of Me. I stand with them, but many will fall and crumble under the pressure to remain silent when they are forced to present to their flock the doctrine of lies to come.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
