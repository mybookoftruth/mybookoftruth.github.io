		<p>My dearly beloved daughter many people do not really understand the mystery of My Second Coming.</p>
<p><strong>My Second Coming is the fulfilment of a New Covenant.</strong></p>
<p>It will be the creation of the perfect Paradise which was lovingly brought to fruition for Adam and Eve by My Beloved Father. At that time all things on earth were in perfect harmony and  according to the Will of God.</p>
<p>The time since My Crucifixion on earth has been painful for humanity because of the reign of Satan who has ruled the earth during this period.</p>
<p>The pact with Satan is almost over and two events must soon take place.</p>
<p>The redemption of the human race will occur during The Warning. From then onwards people, including those who are ignorant of the existence of God, will embrace the Truth.</p>
<p>Others who will respond slowly to this great miracle, when the proof will be presented to them, will convert in time. They too will seek forgiveness for their sinful lives.</p>
<p><strong>Then comes the final stage, the sanctification – the final purification so that the whole of humanity is fit to enter the perfect Paradise.</strong></p>
<p>This is the Paradise inhabited originally by Adam and Eve. It will only be then the Divine Will of My Father, where all people will love and respect the Will of My Father, is to be accomplished at last.</p>
<p><strong>Before this all comes to pass there will be much opposition to the Will of My Father being finally realised.</strong></p>
<p>God’s children will be pulled in every direction. Although the Holy Spirit will be poured out over the whole world during The Warning, every effort will be made by Satan to stop this global confession.</p>
<p>He, and his wicked followers, are also preparing for The Warning. Their goal is to convince everyone that it did not happen.</p>
<p>So many people will find it difficult to openly accept God’s love and the existence of the New Paradise as long as Satan walks the earth.</p>
<p>Freedom will only come when he is banished.</p>
<p><strong>Sadly, those who will fail to see the Truth, and who will stubbornly refuse to accept God, will never see Paradise.</strong></p>
<p>Please say this Crusade Prayer  to accept the Divine Will of My Father.</p>
<p><strong>Crusade Prayer (69) Prayer to God the Father to accept His Divine Will</strong></p>
<p><strong>God the Almighty Father I accept Your Divine Will</strong></p>
<p><strong>Help Your children to accept it</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stop Satan from denying Your children’s right to their Father’s</strong></p>
<p><strong>inheritance</strong></p>
<p><strong>Never let us give up the fight for our inheritance in Paradise</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hear our pleas to banish Satan and his fallen angels</strong></p>
<p><strong>I ask You Dear Father to cleanse the earth with Your Mercy and to<br>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>cover us with Your Holy Spirit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lead us to form your most Holy army, laden with the power to banish the beast forever. Amen.</strong></p>

<p>Go in peace.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
