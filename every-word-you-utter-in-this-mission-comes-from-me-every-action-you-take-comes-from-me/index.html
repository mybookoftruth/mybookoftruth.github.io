		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, <strong>be at ease every time you face the many obstacles, which you and all of My followers face daily in this Work to save souls.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Always remember that Satan will never stop tormenting this and other missions, which are authentic, for they come from God.</strong> The authentic missions, which I bless today and those I blessed over the centuries always suffered, because of opposition.</p>
<p>Only the missions, which truly come from God, attract such hatred. Only true prophets attract hatred. Moses, Elijah, Noah and John the Baptist and others like them drew hatred, because of Satan’s influence over weak souls. Only I, Jesus Christ, one of hundreds of prophets during My Time on Earth, attracted the type of hatred, which was inflicted upon Me. And now, only you, My last prophet, will attract hatred of a kind not seen for a long time – though others, like you, have suffered in recent times.</p>
<p><strong>When you have to endure opposition, in the Name of God, know that, when the Holy Trinity presents the Word to humanity through a prophet, it will be the worst kind.</strong> Only for the Divine Assistance given to you, you would flee in terror. My Father protects you, My little one, and so you must forge ahead always in the knowledge that He desires souls, for every word which is uttered from your lips, for every word, which is drawn by your hand and for every soul you reach out to. All this suffering will bring Me more souls.</p>
<p><strong>Be assured that the time for Me to return to reclaim My Throne is close and as the Day draws nearer many tactics will be used to trip you up in this Mission.</strong> <strong>Every lie will be thrown at you, every stone hurled, every torment your lot and every enemy of God placed on every path you turn.</strong> But, as the Redeemer of humanity, I will ensure that every bramble is carefully removed, every stone thrown to one side, every path cleared, so that you will succeed in bringing My Word before the world, at a time when I will be all but forgotten.</p>
<p>I walk with you, My daughter. I rest My Hand upon your left shoulder, in order to shelter you from evil and I guide you in every way. Every word you utter in this Mission comes from Me. Every action you take comes from Me.<strong> Every suffering you endure is Mine.</strong> Your will is Mine, for you gave it away to Me and now I reside completely within you. <strong>When they hurt you, they insult Me. When they mock you, they deny the Truth. When they deny the Word, they deny Me, but when they accept My Word, given to you, they become part of Me and so they too will be given My Protection also.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Go now, My daughter, and never fret when hatred is shown to you in this Mission, for you and all those who hear My Call will then be in no doubt Who it is that they oppose. It is not you, but I, Jesus Christ, they push away.</strong> When you are for Me, with Me, in Me and speak My Word – you are truly a child of God.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
