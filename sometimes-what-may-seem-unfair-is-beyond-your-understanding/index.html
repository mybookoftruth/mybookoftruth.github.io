		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, those who deny Me because they believe that were I to exist, a Loving God would never permit suffering or allow unexpected tragedies, illnesses or premature deaths to take place.</p>
<p>God gives life and He takes it away as He desires and, for every Act of God, good will always come from it, either in the world you live in, or in My Heavenly Kingdom. <strong>It is a lack of trust in Me, which creates bitterness in the souls who judge Me on acts they believe to be cruel and unnecessary. What they do not know is that there is a</strong> <strong>time for everything – a time for living and a time for dying – and that God is the Author of Life. Only He can decide when to take it away.</strong></p>
<p>Suffering by the hands of others is something, which is caused by sin – not by God. When man chooses different paths in life, it is entirely by his own choice as to which one he takes. Some choose wisely, according to their own conscience, and understand the difference between right and wrong. Others will choose the path, which they believe will bring them the necessities they need to sustain them in the world. But, there will be those who choose unwisely and embark upon a path of selfishness, wickedness and greed.</p>
<p><strong>All good things come from God. Sometimes, what may seem to be unfair is beyond your understanding, but know that God chooses how He gathers fruit for the good of man. And, suffering is part of this Plan in His Salvation of souls.</strong> He does not relish suffering, but it is a form of purification. If you suffer, God will try to use this suffering for the good of your own soul. But, He will never force you to do anything because He gives you free will. Abuse of your free will can lead to terrible sin and yet, God will never take your free will away from you. <strong>Free will is sacrosanct. It was given free to man by God, and it is the one Gift that He will never take away from you. It is through the free will of man, however, that man falls from Grace and into sin.</strong></p>
<p>The evil one plays on man’s free will through the temptation of the senses. Free will is a Gift as, when used properly, it can give great Glory to God. But, when it is abused to commit terrible atrocities, it is used by Satan to curse humanity.</p>
<p>The battle for souls will end when man’s free will becomes one with the Will of God. Only then, will man be free of all things, which bring him sorrow and suffering of any kind.</p>
<p>The Will of God will reign in the world to come, which has no end.</p>

<p>Your Jesus</p>
