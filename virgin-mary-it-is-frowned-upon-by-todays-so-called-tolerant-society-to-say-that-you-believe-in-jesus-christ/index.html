		<p>My child I weep at this time because of the way God’s children are afraid or embarrassed to declare their love for His Son Jesus Christ.<br>
<strong><br>
So many in the world today, who love My Son, are embarrassed to openly proclaim His Name in public for fear of being reprimanded.</strong></p>
<p>It is frowned upon by today’s so called tolerant society to say that you believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of Man and that you believe in His Teachings.</p>
<p>Yet many never think twice about using His Holy Name, many times throughout the day, when uttering profanities.</p>
<p>His Name is spoken very often but not in the way it is meant to be.</p>
<p>So many are afraid to be open about their love for my Son in a world which frowns on Christianity.</p>
<p><strong>Christianity is despised by two thirds of the world.</strong></p>
<p>Christians are bullied, scorned and often persecuted like no other religion in the world.</p>
<p>God’s chosen people, the Jews, also suffer and have been persecuted in the most inhumane manner because of who they are. A chosen race, they will be converted soon and will welcome the Messiah, the second time, although they failed to accept Him the first time.</p>
<p>Children you must never be afraid to declare your love for my Son. When you express your love for Him openly and fearlessly people many will listen. Then the more you proclaim His Holy Word the more confident you will become.</p>
<p>Then you will receive more graces to give you the strength to take the next step.</p>
<p>After a while it will not concern you what others think of you. Yet many will be impressed with your honesty and many will want to know more about my Son.</p>
<p>Now is the time to speak about my Son’s Mercy to as many people as you can.</p>
<p>They must be told about His Divine Mercy, the greatest Gift of The Warning, which will be seen throughout the whole world. Then, afterwards, they will know the Truth and many more will want to hear these messages from Heaven.</p>
<p>Thank you my child for responding to my call.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother in Heaven<br>
Mother of Salvation</p>
