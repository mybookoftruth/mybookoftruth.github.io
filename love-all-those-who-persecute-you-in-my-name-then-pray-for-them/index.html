		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, you must inform all of My followers that their prayers will help to mitigate much of what has been foretold.</p>
<p>Prayer is so powerful, that if enough of the prayers I give to the world, through the Crusade Prayers, are said, that much of the difficult tribulation can be curtailed.</p>
<p>I also must point to the power of forgiveness. When you are persecuted, in My Name, you must pray for those souls who torment you. When you pray for them, from the heart, I will cover them with your love. When you pray for your enemies, you delay Satan’s mission to take souls away from Me.</p>
<p>My daughter, I must now instruct you,  and My followers, to remain calm in the face of much opposition to these Messages.  You must never fear the Word of God, even when it brings you much pain from the outside world.</p>
<p>Do not think that My Kingdom is easy to enter. For each of you who truly loves Me, there will be one or two more people tempted to stop you in your allegiance to Me. This has been the case since My Death on the Cross. It will remain this way until My Second Coming.</p>
<p>My disciples will attract those souls who seek Me out. My disciples will then embrace these souls, so that My followers will swell to become one, in union with Me. It will never be without suffering, this lonely pathway to My Kingdom.</p>
<p>When they throw accusations at you, think of My own journey to Calvary. Think of My silence, and the dignity of simply focusing on My sole objective, to save souls, for every second you endure ridicule, in My Name.</p>
<p>This will make your journey more bearable. Let your detractors scream abuse; let them call you a fool; let them declare My Messages to be heresy. For when you do this, their wicked tongues will have no power over you.</p>
<p>Love all those who persecute you, in My Name. Then pray for them. And when you forgive them, you will destroy the power which Satan holds over them.</p>
<p>This is the secret of humility.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
