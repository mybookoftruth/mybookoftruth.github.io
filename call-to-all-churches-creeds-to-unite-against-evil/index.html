		<p>To My churches around the world, hear My call. All you children and followers belong to Me. So many of you are following the teachings of your church and God the Creator of Mankind. That is good. Many of you interpret the Teachings of My Eternal Father in different ways. This has come about through the interpretations of the prophets since time began.</p>
<p>Many prophets interpreted the Teachings of God in the way that the Message was received by them. Some of My prophet’s words have been tampered with. All of My prophets were given the Truth. Not all of My prophets managed to ensure that their followers stayed on one path to eternal life.</p>
<p>All paths lead to God the Creator of mankind. The followers of God interpret the Teachings in different ways that lead to confusion. Once confusion sets in you can be sure that the only way is to simplify your beliefs. Simply believe in and honour your Creator.</p>
<p>I call on all the churches, religions and faiths around the world to pray for mankind and those of no faith – now. Love of God does not have anything to do with the destruction of life. No man has the right, in My Name, or My Eternal Father’s, to take a life in His Name. Instead, come together and unite in your love for your Creator in the face of evil, as it swiftly arises all around you.</p>
<p>My children, let Me remind you of God’s Laws. The Ten Commandments sent to you by My Eternal Father, through His most holy and devout prophet Moses. These rules were designed to instruct God’s children, as to the ways in which they must pay homage to Him, to guide them towards the Truth. So many people today have forgotten this. Those who have not, rarely consider what they really mean. Those who do not understand the Ten Commandments choose to interpret them in a way that is far removed from the Truth. To those, I say please read The Ten Commandments and listen or risk facing the Wrath of God. Their meaning must not be diluted behind false love, false compassion or by justifying sin in the face of what you have been told.</p>
<p>The first Commandment tells you to adore only one Creator, My Eternal Father, and to avoid idolatry. Yet that first Commandment has been thrown asunder in favour of false gods. By false gods I do not necessarily mean only people in high places or those who exalt themselves at the highest, so that you, My children, fall down in ecstasy at their feet. Yes this is an offence and deeply insulting in the Eyes of God. The idolatry I now refer to is mankind’s love of power and money, which can drive My children into empty despair. This despair leads to the breaking of the other rule, the sin of self-obsession. The desire to look after your own road in life, at the expense of your soul, will be your downfall. Love of self, is not love. It is vanity. Yet, that is a popular doctrine today. You are, under the guise of false compassion, exalting yourself and denying God. Your lack of humility will bring about your destruction. When you place yourself ahead of others, they, and other people, will suffer for it. This Commandment must not ever be broken. Human reasoning, which is used to justify sin, is an absurdity.</p>
<p><strong>Obsession with Celebrity</strong><br>
For the young people who have lacked guidance for so long, they are now being sucked into the abyss of idolatry in ways that are clear for all to see. The very idols My young children worship, are for the most part, not of the Light. Many have sold their souls to the devil, a fact they proudly boast of.</p>
<p>Their hypnotic appeal, through their music and words, convince My children that this is the true path to follow. Their appealing immorality encourages their followers to emulate them. When they do, they, My children, block the Light, as they too are sucked into eternal darkness. The obsession with celebrity in the world of today, means that My children feel anxious all the time, as they strive to reach the same heights, as those who follow the deceiver claim to enjoy.</p>
<p>Come now, all My children, of all churches and creeds. Join together and fight for the right to retain belief in God the Eternal Father, the right to love one another, the right to pure love, the Love of God the Eternal Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p>Your loving Saviour and Just Judge<br>
Jesus
