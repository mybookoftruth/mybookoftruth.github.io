		<p>My dearest daughter, many people still reject Me in the world and it has to do with public opinion. So much darkness has descended over all of God’s children that very few have the courage to publicly proclaim My Word.</p>
<p>Believers are frightened of the verbal abuse and vicious mockery they would have to endure were they to speak openly of My Holy Word.</p>
<p>Even devout followers lack the nerve to stand up and fight evil laws introduced in their countries, which defy the Word of My Father.</p>
<p><strong>Priests are embarrassed to be seen to stand up for the Truth of My Teachings, for fear of being ostracised.</strong></p>
<p>Now, more than ever, because of the shame they have to endure, because of the wicked sins of some of their own orders, they find it impossible for their voices to be heard.</p>
<p><strong>When a brave sacred servant decides to stand up and defend the Truth of My Teachings, they suffer terribly. They are accused of lack of tolerance, lack of compassion, lack of love and lack of respect for human rights.</strong></p>
<p>You see, children, the Truth of My Teachings, spoken through My sacred servants is treated as a lie.</p>
<p>Lies, those twisted versions of the Truth contained in Holy Scripture, are presented as the truth instead.</p>
<p><strong>Satan has won over so many souls, including leaders within My Own Church, which has meant that many innocent people find it hard to pledge allegiance to My Holy Will.</strong></p>
<p>How I have been deserted and pushed to one side, to allow the lies, planted in the minds of My sacred servants, to be accepted by the majority.</p>
<p>These wicked lies extend way beyond this.</p>
<p>The Truth of My Scripture contained in the Book of Revelation has been interpreted by My many churches, so many variations, all of which are based on human interpretation.</p>
<p>My beloved Pope Benedict XVI is the last true pope on this Earth.</p>
<p>Peter the Roman, is My Peter, the original apostle, who will rule My Church from the Heavens, under the command of My Eternal Father. Then, when I come to Reign, at the Second Coming, he will rule over all of God’s children when all religions will become one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.</p>
<p>I only speak the Truth, My daughter.</p>
<p>I must warn you that many new self-proclaimed prophets will now emerge, who will contradict My Holy Word given to you, the end time true prophet.</p>
<p>First they will convince believers that their words come from Me.</p>
<p>Their words will be carefully chosen and their meaning will be vague and a little confusing. But many will dismiss this weakness and embrace their Messages, because they seem to be in line with Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>When many souls have been seduced, the attack will begin.</p>
<p>They, My daughter, are being sent to prepare God’s children to accept the next pope, who comes after My beloved Vicar ,Pope Benedict. This pope may be elected by members within the Catholic Church, but he will be the false prophet.</p>
<p>His electors are wolves in sheep’s clothing and are members of the secret Masonic and evil group led by Satan.</p>
<p>This is how Satan will try to destroy My Church.</p>
<p>Sadly, he will, this false prophet, attract a large following. Those who oppose him will be persecuted.</p>
<p>Run children, while you can. Denounce the lies, which will be presented by those who attempt to convince you of the authenticity of the false prophet.</p>
<p>Be strong. Stay faithful to Me, your Jesus. Never doubt My Holy Word.</p>
<p>The Book of Revelation is the True Word of God. It does not lie.</p>
<p>Not all of the secrets contained within are known to you, yet. I will reveal all, through Maria Divine Mercy, although the Truth will be vehemently attacked and treated as heresy.</p>
<p>Remember one important lesson. My Word, when I was on Earth, was treated as heresy when I came the first time.</p>
<p>My Word, given to you now, at My Second Coming, will also be treated as such, by believers, including My sacred servants, who represent My Church on Earth.</p>
<p>Satan will sacrifice many souls to satisfy his final cravings to cause the greatest heartache.</p>
<p>Be assured that it will be the Catholic Church, founded by Me and placed under the command of My beloved apostle, Peter, which will suffer the greatest in the end times.</p>
<p>Be on your guard at all times.</p>
<p>Please recite this <strong>Crusade Prayer (44) Strength to defend my Faith against the false prophet</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Dear Jesus, give me the strength to focus on Your Teachings and to proclaim Your Holy Word at all times. Never allow me to be tempted to idolise the false prophet, who will try to present himself as You. Keep my love for You strong. Give me the Graces of discernment, so that I will never deny the Truth contained in the Holy Bible no matter how many lies are presented to me to encourage me to turn my back on Your True Word. Amen.”</strong></p>
<p>The Truth is written in Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>The Book of Revelation does not reveal all because I come only now, the Lamb of God, to open the Book for the world to see.</p>
<p>Any human interpretation regarding the 1,000 years is not to be trusted.</p>
<p>You must only trust in the Word of God.</p>
