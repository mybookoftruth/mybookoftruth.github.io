		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Rosary is divided into <strong>five decades</strong>. Each decade represents a <a href="#mysteries">mystery</a> or event in the life of Jesus. There are four sets of Mysteries of the Rosary (<a href="#joyful">Joyful</a>, <a href="#luminous">Luminous</a>, <a href="#sorrowful">Sorrowful</a>, and <a href="#glorious">Glorious</a>) and they are said on specific days of the week. The Rosary therefore contains a total of twenty mysteries. During private recitation of the Rosary, each decade requires devout meditation on a specific mystery. Public recitation of the Rosary<em>(two or more people)</em>, requires a leader to announce each of the mysteries before the decade</a></p>

<p><strong>To begin the Rosary</strong> you say <a href="#apostles-creed">The Apostle’s Creed</a> on the crucifix. Then you say the <a href="#our-father">Our Father</a> and three <a href="#hail-mary">Hail Mary</a>s on the beads connected to the crucifix and a <a href="#glory-be">Glory Be to the Father</a>.</p>
<p>Then you come to the mysteries or decades. At the beginning of each decade you announce the mystery e.g. in the Sorrowful Mysteries you begin with the suffering in the Garden and then start by reciting the Our Father, then 10 Hail Marys and finish with one Glory Be and, finally, the short <a href="#fatima-prayer">prayer of Fatima</a>.</p>
<p>When you have finished the ten decades say One Our Father, One Hail May and Glory be to the Father and finally the <a href="#hail-holy-queen">Hail Holy Queen</a></p>
<ul>
<li>When you carry a Rosary, satan has a headache</li>
<li>When you use it, he collapses</li>
<li>When he sees you praying it, he faints</li>
<li>Let us pray the rosary every time, so that he’ll keep fainting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prayers of the Rosary</h2>
<a name="prayer-before-rosary"></a>
<p><strong>Prayer Before the Rosary</strong></p>
<p>Queen of the Holy Rosary, Thou didst deign to come to Fatima to reveal to the three shepherd children the treasures of grace hidden in the Rosary. Inspire my heart with a sincere love of this devotion, in order that by meditating on the Mysteries of our Redemption which are recalled in it, I may be enriched by its fruits and obtain peace for the world, the conversion of sinners and of Russia, and the graces which I ask of Thee in this Rosary. (Here mention your request.) I ask this for the greater glory of God, for Thine own honor, and for the good of souls, especially for my own. Amen.</p>
<a name="our-father"></a>
<p><strong>The Our Father:</strong></p>
<p>Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>
<a name="hail-mary"></a>
<p><strong>The Hail Mary:</strong></p>
<p>Hail Mary, full of grace! the Lord is with thee; blessed are thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.</p>
<a name="glory-be"></a>
<p><strong>Glory be to the Father:</strong></p>
<p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>
<a name="fatima-prayer"></a>
<p><strong>Fatima Prayer</strong> (Prayer to Jesus requested by Our Lady of Fatima)</p>
<p>O My Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell, take all souls to Heaven, and help especially those most in need of Your mercy.</p>
<a name="apostles-creed"></a>
<p><strong>The Apostles’ Creed:</strong></p>
<p>I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ His only Son, Our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into Hell; the third day He arose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.</p>
<a name="hail-holy-queen"></a>
<p><strong>Hail Holy Queen:</strong></p>
<p>Hail! Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our life, our sweetness and our hope. To you do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To you do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, O most gracious advocate, your eyes of mercy towards us; and after this our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus. O clement! O loving! O sweet Virgin Mary!</p>
<p>Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer After the Rosary</strong></p>
<p>O God, whose only-begotten Son, by His life, death and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life; grant, we beseech Thee, that, meditating upon these mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ our Lord. Amen</p>
