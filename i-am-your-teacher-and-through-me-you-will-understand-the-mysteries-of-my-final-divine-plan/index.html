		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, <strong>if people realised the Gift I Am to bestow upon humanity, where I will raise to life the dead and the saints, who will join those of you granted the Gift of Eternal Life in My Kingdom, you would truly understand then this very special blessing.</strong></p>
<p>To lose a loved one to death, on earth, can be very sorrowful and causes distressing pain. But My Promise to unite you, with those who have died in a state of Grace, as one, will unite all of God’s children in a truly glorious way.</p>
<p><strong>Families will unite.</strong> Loved ones will gather together and this will result in a great celebration. All those blessed to be taken into My New Paradise, which offers eternal life, will be astonished by the magnitude of My Great Gift.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare for death. Do not fear it.</strong> But, know that Heaven is not easy to enter. Much spiritual preparation is required. When you understand clearly the wonderful life, which awaits you, at My Second Coming, then you will understand what is expected of you.</p>
<p><strong>You must, not only, follow My instructions at this time, you must take on the responsibility of helping Me to salvage the souls of those who have no interest in Me and who have no desire in saving their souls, redeeming themselves before Me, or receiving the Sacraments.</strong> This is because they have made a conscious decision to keep My Existence separate from their day-to-day lives. I Am something they may be vaguely aware of  – some spiritual concept, which they cannot understand. The reason is that they are not interested in making the changes, which are necessary if they are to become worthy of My Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>These lost lukewarm souls are My greatest concern, because their numbers are large</strong>, and slowly, they are drifting further and further away from Me. I pine for their souls. The only way I can encourage them is through modern day communications, in order to get their attention. Every stone will be upturned. Everything in My Power will be done to bring them to Me.</p>
<p><strong>Then, finally, there are the souls – through no fault of their own – who have never heard of Me.</strong> Who never knew about My death on the Cross, or the implications this bears on the future of their existence. I need to show them the Truth. I need to teach them. I need to make My Messages simple. I need to show them the proof of the existence of their souls, and you, My Army, will help Me to do this.</p>
<p><strong>There will be many tasks required of you in the salvation of all souls, and I, your Jesus, will show you how these are to be brought about. I will instruct you in greater detail and I hope you will respond to My Call, no matter how impossible the task may seem.</strong></p>
<p>Love Me and trust in Me, for <strong>I Am your Teacher,</strong> and through Me, you will understand the mysteries of My Final Divine Plan. Then all will be done and the world will be ready for My Glorious Return.</p>
<p>Your beloved Teacher</p>
<p>Jesus Christ</p>
