		<p>My daughter, these months have been a difficult time, not only for you, but for all of My beloved children.</p>
<p>I Am the Father of Creation and Love, with a deep passion for each child of Mine, no matter how they offend Me.</p>
<p><strong>There is so much preparation required to help prepare souls for the Coming of My beloved Son, Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
<p>Much of humanity is suffering at this time because of persecution. This persecution not only consists of poverty and lack of money, but hunger of spirit.</p>
<p><strong>As the Father of all humanity, I Am ready to send My Son back to reclaim His Rightful Throne.</strong></p>
<p>Only I know of this time. Not even My Son is aware of the date.</p>
<p><strong>I can tell you it will be soon and that most of this generation, alive in the world today, will live for the Day of My Son’s Return in Great Glory.</strong></p>
<p>I now prepare to gather all of My children as I take them away from the terrible abyss of suffering they have had to endure in the wilderness.</p>
<p>This wilderness was created by the hand of Lucifer and all his fallen angels who have roamed the Earth since the fall of Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>Today, many of My children find it impossible to believe in Me, God their Creator and Father.</p>
<p>I have blessed My children with intelligence and an independent free will where they can choose whatever way they decide to live their lives.</p>
<p>To guide them towards My Kingdom I gave them the Ten Commandments, which are cast in stone.</p>
<p>They have never changed, yet My children feel they were smarter than they are and created new meanings, which are unacceptable to Me.</p>
<p>This time for the end of the reign of all of the demons cast out and who flood the Earth, is almost at an end.</p>
<p><strong>I call out to all My children to listen. Your time on Earth, as you know it, is drawing to an end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yet there is a new Earth, a New Paradise waiting for you.</strong></p>
<p>It will surpass anything you could ever imagine and it has been prepared for some time, with love for every single man, woman and child.</p>
<p>At last I will unite all of My precious family and we will all live in harmony, peace, love and joy for eternity.</p>
<p>For those who refuse to enter the New Paradise I will do everything in My Power to stop you from turning your back on the inheritance, which is rightfully yours.</p>
<p>Because of the Gift of your free will, which I will never take away from you, the choice is yours.</p>
<p>All it takes is a turn of your head and the opening of your heart.</p>
<p>Then you must run into My Arms, so I can take you home.</p>
<p>This is My dearest and most treasured wish, to take all of My cherished children home to the rightful place to which they belong.</p>
<p>Your Loving Father</p>
<p>God the Most High</p>
