		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, much of the suffering experienced by men, in the years ahead, will be that of the spirit.</p>
<p>The spiritual suffering will be felt not only by My followers, who remain true to the Word of God, but by all men, irrespective as to what they believe.  Satan and his demons, from the highest ranking to the lowliest, roam throughout the world, spreading hatred amongst God’s children. Hatred has gripped the human race and can be seen in many ways. When Satan tempts a soul into a cocoon of hatred, he does this by creating a feeling of jealousy in the vulnerable person and soon this turns into hatred. Hatred is spreading and it affects every age.</p>
<p><strong>The spirit of love and charity, once present in the hearts of mankind, has weakened and this means that the love, which joined communities, nations and countries together, has been broken. People have lost love in their lives because they no longer revere Me. I, Jesus Christ, have been forgotten. So busy are they in dealing with worldly matters that they have created, for themselves, a very lonely existence. Once love is missing in your lives, a great part of you is left to dry up and withers like a starving plant. </strong></p>
<p>God is Love, and when love is present in the world, there is greater harmony and peace. The opposite to love is hatred, which comes from the devil. <strong>If you allow hatred to fill your hearts, it will fester inside you and grow like a cancer until it devours you. Hatred destroys lives and creates terrible divisions. It poisons your soul. It creates deep unhappiness in the souls of those who have allowed it to dictate every action they take.</strong> Hatred spreads from one soul to another very quickly because, once you engage with a person who is full of hatred, it will gain a grip over you by tempting you to listen to every reason given to justify it.</p>
<p>Christians, who allow hatred to infest them, must never succumb to using My Holy Name to incite hatred of any kind against another human being. You must ask Me to rid your soul of hatred because if you allow it take over your soul, you will never see My Face.</p>
<p>Use the time accorded to you, to love Me more, for when you truly love Me, this love will be reciprocated. You will then be incapable of taking part in any kind of dialogue where hatred is present.</p>
<p>Love Me and you will find it easier to love others. If you hate another person you do not know Me.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
