		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, the time is almost here for the world to reflect on My death on the Cross.</p>
<p>This is the time, during 2012, that I urgently need your prayers for those who will not recognise Me and for those who do not know about Me.</p>
<p>It will be up to you, My beloved followers, to help Me save those poor souls, whom I need to bring close to My Bosom, so that I can prepare them for My New Paradise.</p>
<p>Children, I need you to say My <a href="/divine-mercy-chaplet/">Divine Mercy</a> Chaplet and commence the nine day Novena of the <a href="/divine-mercy-chaplet/">Divine Mercy</a>, from Good Friday.</p>
<p>It is important that as many of you complete this Novena for other souls. You will receive great Graces and for this I will never forsake you. I will salvage your soul when you come before Me on the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>You must never become tired of praying to save other souls. You are My Army and through the Graces I give you, you will work with Me to clean the Earth of sin, before My Second Coming.</p>
<p>Praying does not come easy to all of you. The best way is to unite yourself in My Sorrowful Passion, and meditate on My suffering and in particular, My Agony in the Garden. My Great Mercy is at its most potent then. It was precisely because of sinners, including those pagans who were never given a chance to know Me, whom I agonised over the most.</p>
<p>For those of you who love Me know this.</p>
<p>The more you trust in Me completely, the stronger is My Mercy. The more I can forgive. My Mercy is so powerful that it can wipe out the sins of all mankind.</p>
<p>Those who believe in Me, trust Me, can achieve great sanctity by helping to save the souls of their brothers and sisters, as a priority. They do this out of their love for Me for they know that this brings Me much consolation.</p>
<p>You, My pure and just followers, who love Me so much, know that it is through your generosity of heart, that I can save sinners.</p>
<p>Sinners, you must understand, are who I died for and are the ones I thirst for most of all. I show great compassion for sinners.</p>
<p>But, you, My followers, who are also sinners, must trust in Me completely. By doing this, I grant a number of special Graces.</p>
<p>The more you ask for My help, the more you receive. It is because of this bond that you and I hold between us, that you can help Me to save other souls from drowning in despair and hopelessness.</p>
<p>Remember the Power of My <a href="/divine-mercy-chaplet/">Divine Mercy</a> Novena and the number of souls you will save for Me, this year.</p>
<p>Your beloved Jesus</p>
