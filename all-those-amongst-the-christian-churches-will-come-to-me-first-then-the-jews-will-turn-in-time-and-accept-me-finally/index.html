		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, as this Mission escalates, <strong>My Word will be spoken in many languages.</strong> My Messages, given to you today, ignite My Holy Word in the New Testament. My Messages also remind the world of the Word of God, which is contained in the most Holy Bible.</p>
<p><strong>I do not rewrite the Word, I simply remind you what it means today.</strong> I also speak to the world to prepare them for My Second Coming, for I do not want them to be lost. It is with great love and joy that I watch how My faithful followers accept Me as I Am. <strong>Those who knew immediately that it was I, Jesus Christ, Who spoke to them through these Messages, are blessed.</strong> They are the ones who never doubted. They could feel My Presence. My Word pierced their hearts like a sword. My Spirit touched their souls. They knew. They recognised Me and how they suffer for this.</p>
<p>You, My precious children, know that <strong>when you responded to My Call that I gave you a special Gift, a blessing,</strong> which will help you to endure this Path to Eternal Life. You will need these Gifts, because <strong>you will be the backbone of My Remnant Army</strong> and you will lead the others, who will eventually follow you.</p>
<p><strong>People of all nations will follow you when they have nowhere to turn and you will share My Teachings with them. </strong> All those loyal to Me, Jesus Christ, will be given new Gifts to help them to unite around the world in union with Me. All those amongst the Christian Churches will come to Me first. Then the Jews will turn, in time, and accept Me finally. All other religions will realise the Truth of My Teachings and they also will follow Me. But not all accept the Truth, even when it is presented to them right before their eyes.</p>
<p>Then there are the non-believers, many of them good people. They use human intellect to put forth all the reasons why God does not Exist. Yet they, including many of their Christian counterparts who are lukewarm in their faith – will run to Me first. Their hearts will be unlocked and because they will only see what witness I bring to bear, they will know that I Call them.  They won’t resist Me, unlike those stubborn souls who think they know more about the promise I made to return to present the Final Covenant, than Me.</p>
<p>Every task I give you, will lead to more and more nations taking up My Cross to create the one pathway towards Me. Never hesitate to walk alongside Me when I Call you, because when you respond to Me, you will destroy the power of evil. Evil may cause you pain, but when you allow Me to guide you, you can overcome any obstacle in your way.</p>
<p>I love you and I guide you, just as I protect My Prayer Groups around the world.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
