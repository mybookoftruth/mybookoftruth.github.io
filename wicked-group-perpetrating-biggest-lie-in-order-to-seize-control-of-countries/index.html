		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, you must tell My children, all those followers of Mine, to <strong>link and form a chain of protection in prayer</strong>.</p>
<p>By joining as brothers and sisters in prayer for those lost children, who wander, seeking love for Me, but who cannot find peace in their souls, you can save them.</p>
<p>They need you to pray for them <strong>because The Warning won’t convert these poor souls</strong>.</p>
<p>You, My loyal followers, bring Me the consolation I need when I see the terrible pain and hardships, which are now being endured by My children in almost every corner of the world.</p>
<p>This wicked group, made up of some of the worlds most powerful and elite are perpetrating the biggest lie through their <strong>deliberate plotting to seize control of countries in the Middle East, Europe and the US.</strong></p>
<p>Their plan is unveiling before your eyes. Can’t you see? This plan has taken decades to develop.</p>
<p>Every one of My children needs to stay awake at all times.</p>
<p>Do not allow them to take your countries. Stand up to them. <strong>Money is their weapon of deceit.</strong> The collapse of your banking systems was deliberate. Now they move to complete the next phase of their plan.</p>
<p>You, children, can stop this evolving through your prayers.</p>
<p><strong>Already My Father is placing obstacles in their way.</strong></p>
<p>My followers span many countries. Now you must join together, in prayer, to stop European leaders, some of whom are intrinsic in bringing about terrible hardship on innocent people, in their wicked ways.</p>
<p><strong>I urge you to say this Crusade Prayer (31) to stop them</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“O my Jesus, let my prayer invoke Your Holy Spirit to descend on those leaders driven by lust, greed, avarice and pride to stop the persecution of Your innocent children. I ask You to stop poverty, famine and wars from devouring Your children. And I pray that European leaders will open their hearts to the Truth of Your Love. Amen.”</em></strong></p>
<p>My daughter, <strong>the chain of prayer will spread out far and wide</strong> and the Power of the Holy Spirit will help stop those people, who have the power to stop suffering and halt them in their actions.</p>
<p>Spread My Word in order to spread conversion.</p>
<p>My time to come to Reign is close. So, there will not be time enough to save all souls.</p>
<p>Do all you can for Me, your Jesus, Who loves and cherishes you all.</p>
<p>We must work together, children, for the sake of all of mankind, in our battle to prevent the antichrist and his atrocious plan of deception.</p>
<p>Hope, love and prayers, children, this is what I expect of you.</p>
<p>I thank you for all your loyalty and obedience.</p>
<p><strong>You have not seen, yet you have believed.</strong> Once you heard My Voice, through these Messages, you recognised Me.</p>
<p>You were able to do this because of the Holy Spirit, which reigns in your souls.</p>
<p>You must share this great Gift so that you can bring all of your loved ones with you into My New Paradise on Earth.</p>
<p>I love each and every one of you. You bring Me such consolation and joy.</p>
<p>Your beloved Jesus</p>
