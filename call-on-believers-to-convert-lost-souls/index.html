		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, the Blessed Trinity unites with you, as one, to drive forward the Divine Truth to every soul in the world, as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>You, My daughter, now feel the pain and suffering in your heart in union with Me for mankind. Their lost faith brings you a deep sadness and sense of fear for their future.</p>
<p>My beloved loyal and devout followers are now, at this time, uniting around the world through the bond of powerful Divine Love to fight to save souls from damnation.</p>
<p>These, My children of the Light, come from all nations. They will recognise each other instantly irrespective of their race, colour or creed. I Am guiding them so that this army of love will help strengthen the faith of mankind at this point in history.</p>
<p>Never before have I made My Presence so evident within the hearts of believers. They feel the suffering I endure, as I witness the heart-wrenching badness that emits from man, even among those who you would deem to be kind and thoughtful. Love of self is destroying My children.</p>
<p>Selfishness and lack of consideration for those around you and for the vulnerable leaves a stain of shame that is hard to erase. The cruelty that man shows to his neighbour, all with one motive in mind – self-satisfaction, has reached an all-time high. The obsession with their own needs is a sin in the eyes of My Eternal Father.</p>
<p>So many false excuses, made in the name of self-worth, are completely unacceptable and against My Teachings. Love one another. Treat others, as you would expect to be treated yourself. Think of others’ needs before your own. Stand up for the human rights of your brothers and sisters when they face the injustice of others. Never, ever, justify punishing one person in order to gain material advantage. Show love and compassion, even for your enemies. This is not an easy task because of the materialist insecurities My children feel. The symptoms of the selfish obsession with wealth, beauty and so- called success that many people believe to be natural attributes of the human makeup, cause terrible confusion.</p>
<p>The idea where people are brainwashed into putting their own needs first, in the name of self- worth, has been implanted in the human psyche for a long time, but this philosophy has been reinforced by the powers of modern communication. When My children hear these messages, almost daily, through TV, the media, the cinema, music and the Internet, they accept these messages as being important.</p>
<p>Despite the false promise, these beliefs, which are appealing in that they offer self-gratification, which is hard to reject, represent, My children accept the lie, the lie that has been planted by the deceiver – Satan.</p>
<p>The disquiet they feel soon afterwards, having taken advantage of someone else, is hard for them to understand. They, My children, having won the coveted prize, are not happy. They then seek out more and more of the same, so insatiable is their appetite. But it is useless. They can’t fully satisfy themselves. They are devoid of real joy, a natural contentment, and don’t understand the emptiness they feel inside.</p>
<p>When you place yourself first, before others, that is selfish. When you take unfair advantage over those who are weaker and more vulnerable than you, that is sinful. When you damage that person’s ability to live in dignity and then deprive them of the right to feed their families adequately, that deeply offends Me. I suffer with these souls. Do unto your neighbour a wrong and you do this to Me. When you hurt your neighbour through words of spite you are guilty of inflicting pain in My Heart.</p>
<p>When man punishes another through violence, I endure the pain of My Passion on the Cross. I relive it. I feel their pain as you inflict bodily harm on them. When you are a murderer, you are guilty of the final indignity of nailing Me to the Cross.</p>
<p>Children, know this. Sin will lead you to Hell. This is frightening for those believers who see Me as a Merciful Judge. My promise of unlimited Mercy, which I will give to each and every one of you who repents, is still guaranteed. But, how can I save those who will not see the error in their mixed-up lives?</p>
<p>Preaching the Truth of My Teachings is important. It is because of the appeal of so many distractions, which abound, that many of My children will find it extremely difficult to recognise the Word of God. Many will not have knowledge of God’s Teachings through the prophets or through Holy Scripture. Many simply don’t want to know. For others, they will refuse to listen even if the Word is spread through My prophets and visionaries of today, with clear signs for all to see. This is why it will be up to the believers to pray for the others. Special prayers are needed now. By praying The <a href="/divine-mercy-chaplet/">Divine Mercy</a>, the powerful prayer, given to My beloved Sister Faustina, much conversion will take place.</p>
<p>When that happens, I request that all My children rejoin in prayer groups to continue to pray for and give guidance to these prodigal children of Mine – your brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>In My Name and the Blessed Trinity, I urge My beloved children to join forces in union with My Heart and help Me save their souls. I love them all so much that I weep sad and bitter tears of terror for them. I don’t want to lose them.</p>
<p>Help Me, My followers in the Light, to reunite these lost souls with My family, so that they too will experience the True Paradise for which they strive so desperately.</p>
<p>Hold out your hand to theirs. Talk to them. Listen to them. Show them compassion, even when they throw it back in your face in scorn. Show patience. Above all make them feel My Love for them through you.</p>
<p>They will find it hard to dismiss you then, even if they mock you. Through your prayers you can, and will, save their souls.</p>
<p>I salute you, My precious followers. You bring tears to My Eyes with the love and devotion you show to Me, My Blessed Mother, Queen of the Heavens and the Blessed Trinity.</p>
<p>We, and all the angels and saints in Heaven rejoice in your response to this calling now. So, go do your Work in the Name of My Eternal Father. Bring back My flock.</p>
<p>Your devoted Saviour<br>
Jesus
