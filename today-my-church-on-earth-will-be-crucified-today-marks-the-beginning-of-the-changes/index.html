		<p><b>Good Friday</b></p>
<p><strong>My dearly beloved daughter, today My Church on earth will be Crucified. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Today marks the beginning of the changes</strong>, which will be rapid and which will come about to change the face of the Catholic Church in the world.</p>
<p>In its wake will come the merging of all doctrines, which will be seen in every public sign and demonstrated deliberately for the sake of public witness.</p>
<p><strong>Watch now, as all I have told you will come to light.</strong> I defy, those amongst you, to deny the awful truth when you are forced to swallow a lie.</p>
<p>You, My followers, must protect My Sacraments and be vigilant. You, My sacred servants, will soon be put to the test, as My Divinity will be challenged. <strong>God’s Laws will be adapted, and as soon as My Holy Eucharist is tampered with, the Hand of God will descend with such force that you will know, immediately, that these Messages come from Heaven.</strong></p>
<p>My Sorrow will become your sorrow. Your grief, because of your knowledge of the Truth, will make it impossible for you to accept the sacrileges, which you will be instructed to embrace.</p>
<p>Even then, if you do not accept My prophet and the Words I give her, I will still give you time. For <strong>very soon you will be asked to renew your vows by those leaders amongst you</strong>. <strong>You will be asked to pledge your life through sworn testimony to the laws of paganism.</strong> If you do this, you will be under the influence of the evil one and you will do battle with God.</p>
<p>You must persevere and remain loyal to Me and you must beg Me for guidance at a time when the man who sits in the Chair of Peter, who refuses to follow in his footsteps or wear his shoes, will destroy your allegiance to God.</p>
<p>As you now witness the Crucifixion of My Church on earth, I will call you to proclaim the Truth of God. I will keep calling you in order to protect you. I will ensure that My Church, those who adhere to My Teachings, My Sacraments and the Word of God, lives on through the remnant who will never desert Me.</p>
<p>There will be those amongst you who will betray Me today. Others amongst you will soon denounce My Sacraments, as you will be too weak to defend the Word of God.  Those of you who already suspect the truth and who try to spread My Word will suffer because you won’t have the courage to stand up for the Truth.  Yet, you will still remain loyal to Me, as you know that you cannot live without My Love.</p>
<p>Listen to My Voice. Lean your weary head upon My Shoulder and allow Me to wrap My Arms around you at this time. I will always protect you.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
