		<p>My dearest daughter, My children must know that there is only one God. Only one. Any other exists only in the minds of man. Any other god is an abomination in My Eyes and the man who succumbs to worshipping false gods, serves only the devil, who delights in man’s fall from Grace.</p>
<p>I Am the Beginning and the End. Nothing can prevail against Me. Even the demons and fallen angels, which I cast into the abyss, will never stand before Me and challenge Me, for they are without such power.</p>
<p>So many religions have been founded by fallible man, and this has caused much confusion. From the beginning I spoke with One Voice and, until the end, there can only be One Voice. The world is Mine for I created it. I created every living thing. I also created My Heavenly Hierarchy from which I threw out those angels who defied and betrayed Me. <strong>Many of these fallen angels communicate with My children who have created a new age form of spiritualism. I warn those of you who adore false gods, through the pursuit of such practices.  Such spiritualism will expose your souls to evil spirits whose only desire is to destroy your souls.</strong></p>
<p>These false angels are demons, disguised as living spirits of the light, and they will seduce you into believing falsities. Every lie about My Heavenly Hierarchy will be fed to you so that you will place all your needs before Satan and evil spirits. All they do is savage your souls like wild beasts and then leave you empty and bereft of any love. At first, when you give yourself over to such idolatry, you will be given a false sense of peace. Demons can give such powers but they are short-lived. For once they gain access to your souls, they will torment you and goad you into demonic acts.</p>
<p>I Am all that was in the Beginning and I Am the End. All begins and ends with Me. When you place false gods before Me, and do this because of your selfish desire to seek pleasure, power and control of your destiny, you are guilty of breaking My First Commandment.</p>
<p>Without Me you could not exist. Without Me you have no future. Without My Son you cannot come to Me. Reject My only beloved Son, Jesus Christ, the True Messiah, and you reject Me.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth was first given to the world when paganism was rife. The Truth was given to the world with the birth of My Son and generations were converted. The Truth is being given again to the world now, as the great apostasy strangles the souls of those who believe in My Son, and at a time when paganism is rife again. Just as it was in the beginning when I was rejected by ungrateful men so, too, will it be in the end, when men’s hearts will turn to stone and their souls, will be given away freely to the devil. </strong> Then, the world as you know it, will be no more as the New Heaven and the New Earth merge as one. Finally, peace will reign again and I will unite those who choose to come with Me.</p>
<p>Your beloved Father</p>
<p>God the Most High</p>
