		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, My Church will be toppled and those who remain true to the Laws of God will suffer greatly because of this.</p>
<p><b>My Church, My True Church, will crawl on its belly as every insult upon My Divinity and the Laws, laid down by My Eternal Father, is hurled at it.</b> Locked within the gates of a gilded prison, many of My servants will be forced to swallow heresy. Not only that, but they will be made to preach it and to convince innocents, that the re-written Word of God, is acceptable in today’s world.</p>
<p>The Anger of My Father, at this time has provoked outrage for, very soon, the Church – having changed beyond recognition – will prepare new rituals, new rules and practices, so that nothing will resemble the Church built by Me.</p>
<p>All of these things have been permitted by My Father, as Satan tests the faith of those who are of Me. Woe to those who betray Me for they will take away with them, the souls of those whose names have been kept for Me. I will fight for these souls. I will punish those enemies of Mine because, through their deceit and cunning, they seduced souls and took them away from Me. For these sins, they will be lost to Me.</p>
<p>My Church sprung from My Loins. I gave you My Body in death and this became My Church. Now it will be defiled and My Body will be crucified again.  Not one ounce of shame will My enemies feel, for their lofty ambitions and self-gratification have nothing to do with Me.</p>
<p>How easily led are those whose faith is weak. How easily led will be those souls, with a strong faith, for they will be fearful of defending the Truth. It will only be the remnant, and those with true allegiance to My Word, who will remain loyal to My Church. And it will be because of them that My Church will never die.</p>

<p>Your Jesus</p>
