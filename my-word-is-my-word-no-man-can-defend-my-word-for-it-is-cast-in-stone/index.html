		<p>My dearly beloved daughter it is important that My followers remain patient.</p>
<p>The future must never be hurried.</p>
<p>The plans, determined by My Eternal Father, will evolve naturally by Divine Providence.</p>
<p>Time afforded to you, to help Me prepare humanity for My Great Mercy, is very precious. It is a time in which many will be saved through your prayers.</p>
<p>Hope, faith and love for me, your beloved Jesus, will sustain you in your mission.</p>
<p>When you witness the atrocities before you, when everything which stands in honour of Me is destroyed, you will know then that the time is getting closer.</p>
<p>You must remember that these things must come to pass and that your duty is to fight and resist the enemy as part of My army.</p>
<p>My Army will be equipped with Divine Gifts and it will sweep along with it those who are in darkness.</p>
<p>Preparation takes time. Prayer brings you closer to My Sacred Heart and floods your souls with the oxygen it needs to survive the battle ahead.</p>
<p>As you grow stronger with the graces I give you it will become very easy to identify your enemies who hate all that I stand for.  This will cause you pain, hurt and anger but you must remain dignified in My Name at all times.</p>
<p>When you are challenged in My Name you must respond with love. Never try to analyse My Messages for you do not need to do so.</p>
<p><strong>My Word is My Word. No man can defend My Word for it is cast in stone.<br>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any man who tries to break My Word or cast aspersions on it, will fail for they are powerless against My Holy Word.</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know My Voice you must know the pain you can expect to endure when you proclaim My Word in these times.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p>Mention My Name today, even among so called Christians, and there is an uncomfortable silence.</p>
<p>Talk openly about good and evil and you will be sneered at.<br>
<strong><br>
Point out how sin can destroy your children and  you will be asked – what is sin?</strong></p>
<p>Today many do not know what sin is. Many accept sin as a normal part, an acceptable trait, in their lives.</p>
<p><strong>They are happy to condone sin because it gives them the freedom to pursue other pleasures, idolise false gods and satisfy their lusts. </strong></p>
<p>No they do not want to listen for it does not suit them.</p>
<p>You, My beloved followers, will be seen as being obsessed with a love for religion and a love of God which today bears little fruit in the eyes of the blind.</p>
<p>This is why you must prepare. This is why you must be strong. It will be for these very souls that you will need to pray and help Me salvage.</p>
<p>Allowing such souls to upset you, hurt you or insult you is a waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>Respond with love and a dignified silence.</strong></p>
<p>Never be afraid to proclaim Me but never force Me upon souls in such a way where they will run away from you. Instead bring them to Me through your prayers and sufferings.</p>
<p>I bless you My strong brave army.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>I walk with you every step you mount to bring Me souls.</p>
<p>Your beloved Jesus Christ</p>
