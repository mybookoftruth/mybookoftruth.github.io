		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, My time for more suffering will come about, as My Passion on the Cross, will be commemorated.</p>
<p>No man understands the extent of My suffering, during My Crucifixion or the way in which I was scourged.</p>
<p><strong>My scourging was the worst. I was beaten savagely –  by ten men and every inch of My Body was slashed.</strong></p>
<p>The Flesh on My Back was torn and My Shoulder Blades were visible.</p>
<p>I could barely stand and one Eye was bruised and crushed.</p>
<p><strong>I could only see through My left Eye.</strong></p>
<p>By the time they took Me before Pontius Pilate and placed the Crown of Thorns on My Head I could barely stand up.</p>
<p>They then stripped Me bare before placing a short red garment over My Head and then placed a palm branch in My right Hand.</p>
<p>Each thorn was like a needle, so sharp was it. <strong>One of these thorns also pierced My right Eye, which left Me barely able to see.</strong></p>
<p>I lost so much Blood that I vomited and was so dizzy that when I began My ascent to Calvary I could not hold the Cross.</p>
<p>I fell so many times, that it took hours before I reached the top of the hill.</p>
<p>I was scourged and whipped each step of the way.</p>
<p>My Body was bloody all over and covered with a thick sweat produced by a scorching sun.</p>
<p>I fainted a few times.</p>
<p>Much as this was painful and agonizing, the most frightening of all was the hatred shown to Me, not just by the adults along the way, but by <strong>young children who kicked Me because they were following their parents’ example</strong>.</p>
<p>The screams that poured out from their mouths and the hatred was nothing compared to the fear they had of Me.</p>
<p>Because, behind it all, they were still not sure whether or not I was, in fact, the Messiah, they were awaiting for so long.</p>
<p><strong>It was easier, therefore, to hate Me, denounce Me, rather than accept Me, for that would have meant that they would have had to change their ways.</strong></p>
<p>My most agonising moment was when I lay on the ground on My Side, having been kicked in the back again and saw My beloved Mother looking at Me.</p>
<p>She was heartbroken and had to be held up by two of My disciples.</p>
<p><strong>I could only see her through the one remaining Eye and I could not bear to watch her torment.</strong></p>
<p>The jeers, screams and roars from the crowds of hundreds could be felt from the ground I lay on and <strong>it took six hundred soldiers to organise and supervise the Crucifixion of Myself and six others</strong>.</p>
<p>I was the main focus of their attention and the others did not suffer like I did.</p>
<p>When My Wrists, at the base of My Thumbs, were nailed to the Cross I could no longer feel.</p>
<p>My Body was so battered and bruised that I had gone into shock.</p>
<p><strong>My Shoulders were dislocated and My Arms were torn out of their sockets.</strong></p>
<p>The worst physical damage was inflicted on My Body, before I was nailed to the Cross.</p>
<p>I let out no scream.</p>
<p>No protest.</p>
<p>Only a whisper.</p>
<p>This infuriated My executioners who wanted a reaction to satisfy their lusts.</p>
<p>I never engaged with them, for to do so would have meant that I would have had to engage with Satan and his demons, who infested their souls.</p>
<p>This is why their viciousness towards Me was so intense.</p>
<p><strong>I was hanging on the Cross for five hours.</strong></p>
<p>The sun was scorching and without clouds to help reduce the burning of My Skin.</p>
<p>As soon as I took My last breathe, My Father sent forth black clouds, as well as thunder and lightning.</p>
<p>The storm that took place was of such a frightening magnitude and so sudden, that My spectators were left in no doubt, at that stage, that I was, indeed, the Saviour, that had been sent by God the Father.</p>
<p>I reveal this to you, My daughter, as a Gift to you in return for the huge act of suffering you have offered Me.</p>
<p><strong>Tell My children that I do not regret My Passion on the Cross.</strong></p>
<p>What I do regret is that My Sacrifice has been forgotten and that so many deny that My Crucifixion took place.</p>
<p><strong>Many have no idea as to what I had to suffer, as many of My apostles did not witness My climb to Calvary.</strong></p>
<p>What hurts Me today is that so many deny Me still.</p>
<p>My appeal to you, My followers, is do not allow My Crucifixion to go to waste.</p>
<p>I died for ALL sins, including those committed today.</p>
<p>I want and I need to save, even those who deny Me, even today.</p>
<p>Your beloved Saviour</p>
