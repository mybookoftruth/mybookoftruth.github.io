		<p>My dearly beloved daughter<b>, I desire that all of My followers conduct a time of fasting</b> from next Monday until 15:30 hours (03:30 PM) on Good Friday.</p>
<p>Even a small token of fasting will glean, for all of you, an insight into My Plan of Salvation and how you can help Me to salvage the souls of all sinners.</p>
<p><b>It is through fasting that you will become whole again.</b> By cleansing your body, your spirit will be renewed. I also desire that you receive the Sacrament of Confession, or what form of reconciliation is available to you. Please, if you are unable to receive this Sacrament then accept the Gift I have given you of My Plenary Indulgence some time ago.</p>
<p>(Tuesday, January 31st, 2012 @ 09:30 PM</p>
<p>You must say this prayer for <b>seven consecutive days</b> to be given the gift of total absolution and the Power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><i>“O my Jesus, You are the Light of the earth . You are the Flame that touches all souls.  Your Mercy and Love knows no bounds.  We are not worthy of the Sacrifice You made by Your death on the Cross . Yet we know that Your Love for us is greater than the love we hold for You.  Grant us, O Lord, the gift of humility, so that we are deserving of Your New Kingdom.  Fill us with the Holy Spirit, so we can march forth and lead Your army  to proclaim the Truth of Your Holy Word and prepare our brothers and sisters  for the Glory of Your Second Coming on earth . We honour You . We praise You . We offer ourselves, our sorrows, our sufferings, as a gift to You to save souls.  We love You, Jesus.  Have Mercy on all Your children wherever they may be.  Amen</i><b>.”)</b></p>
<p><b>Then in spirit, I wish you to join with Me, as if you were present with My apostles at My Last Supper.</b> You will share with Me, the unleavened bread and eat with Me at My table. You, My followers, can share with Me, My Cup of Suffering, by your own free will, should you accept My offer.</p>
<p>If you can accept this, you will, in atonement for the sins of mortal man, save millions of souls<b>. I will grant Mercy to the most hardened sinners, in return for your gift of suffering.</b></p>
<p>Here is the Crusade Prayer for you if you wish to share My Cup of Suffering. <b>Recite this, three times, when you can,</b> but preferably during any time of fasting.</p>
<p><b>Crusade Prayer (103) To share the Cup of Suffering with Christ</b><b></b></p>
<p><i>I lay before You, dear Jesus, and at Your Feet to do what You will with me for the good of all.</i></p>
<p><i>Let me share Your Cup of Suffering.</i></p>
<p><i>Take this gift from me, so that You can save those poor souls who are lost and without hope.</i></p>
<p><i>Take me, in body, so I can share Your Pain.</i></p>
<p><i>Hold my heart in Your Sacred Hands and bring my soul in union with You.</i></p>
<p><i>Through my gift of suffering, I allow Your Divine Presence to embrace my soul, so that You can redeem all sinners and unite all God’s children forever and ever. Amen.</i></p>
<p><b>This sacrifice on your part, presented to Me, Jesus Christ, Redeemer of all humanity, will enable Me to pour My Great Mercy over the whole world.</b></p>
<p>More importantly, I will save even those who hate Me. Your prayers and sacrifice are their only saving grace, for without this, they would be destroyed by the evil one.</p>
<p><b>If you do not wish to endure this suffering, I will grant you great blessings</b> and ask that you continue with Me on My journey to awaken the world from its slumber and so I can lift the veil of deceit which covers it.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
