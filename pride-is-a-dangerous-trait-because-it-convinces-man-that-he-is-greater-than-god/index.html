		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, mankind is ignorant of the Divine Laws and the Divine Will of My Father.<strong> Man is a creature of God and, as such, has not been given the Gift of Knowledge in relation to many secrets known only to the angels and saints in Heaven.</strong> Therefore, one man cannot say he knows why My Father allows certain events to take place in the world, while another man claims that he is privy to the origin of the universe. Man is simply a servant of God, but God, because He wanted to create man in His perfect Image, granted him many gifts and talents. <strong>He never gave man the Knowledge of the Tree of Life and this was for a reason.</strong> Man destroyed his standing in God’s Eyes, when Adam and Eve separated themselves from Him, because of the sin of pride. The sin of pride continues today and is the cause of much separation from God. Pride is a dangerous trait because it convinces man that he is greater than God. Pride tempts man to interfere with God’s Laws of Divinity. This includes the belief that man has the right to decide who is given the Gift of Life and who has the right to take it away.</p>
<p>Pride also convinces man that he knows how the universe was created, when he is, in fact, ignorant of such a miracle. <strong>Only God has the Power to create anything. Only God can decide how much He will permit man to explore or tamper with His Creation.</strong> Yet, man believes that he knows all the answers. <strong>When man believes that he controls his own destiny, and the destiny of others, he falls into serious error because when he imitates the sin of Lucifer, he will be cast away.</strong> When man refuses to respond to his Creator, He will no longer be there to comfort him on the last day.</p>
<p><strong>You must never allow pride to convince you that you know all things of this world and beyond it, for this is impossible.</strong> Instead you must listen, accept the instructions laid down in the Holy Gospels, so that you can live in peace and in accordance with My Father’s Will. For when you humble yourselves before Him, He will show you great glory and then you will understand the great mystery of His Glorious Kingdom on the last day.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
