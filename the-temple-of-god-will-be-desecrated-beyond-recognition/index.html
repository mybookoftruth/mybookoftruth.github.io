		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, the new dawn has arisen and the changes have commenced in preparation for My Second Coming.</p>
<p>Wars in the Middle East will now escalate and many will die by the hands of the evil group. They, the evil group, are going to be stopped, however, by the Hand of My Father. Each one struck down, as they pose a greater danger to God’s children.</p>
<p>My Plans are being manifested and those among you, chosen by Me to lead the remnant Church will swiftly build bases throughout the world. These places will be where you will go to  honour Me, in peace, when your churches will not welcome you in the way it is meant to be.</p>
<p>Your churches will become no more than places of entertainment where pagan rituals and music will be staged in elaborate ceremonies. Supposedly, these events will be to honour God. Instead, they will idolise sinful acts and they will declare them to be in accordance with My Teachings.</p>
<p>Many will present themselves, soon, as the new servants of God. Many will never have been prepared in the Christian Church and, therefore, will not be fit to present the Holy Sacraments to God’s children. They will be imposters. They will dictate to all, the truth of what, they say, are the teachings of God in today’s world. Their lies will reach the ears of humanity all over the world.</p>
<p>Many will be attracted to what they will perceive to be a fresh, new approach, to My Teachings and the Love of God. All will be a terrible lie. Many will be deceived into accepting the new One World Religion.</p>
<p>As the false church grows and attracts many celebrities, the media and political leaders, My Remnant Church will grow. Many of My sacred servants will be disloyal to Me and join in the new One-World Religion where they will be welcomed with open arms.</p>
<p>These imposters will cause terrible hardship for Christians everywhere, if they do not accept this new, politically endorsed cultural organisation, which will call itself a church of God.</p>
<p><strong>While Christians will be the main target of hatred, the House of Israel will also be sought out and the Jews will be made scapegoats in this war for souls.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Nothing you see will appear to be different on the exterior in the early days. Soon, there will be seen, a rich and powerful building in Rome which will become a meeting place. All religions will be made welcome here until they are forced to swallow the lies presented to them by the New World Order.</p>
<p><strong>It will, in time, become unacceptable for certain Christian practices to be held in public</strong>.</p>
<p>These will include the <strong>Sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion</strong>. They will be deemed to be unacceptable in a modern and secular world and you will find it impossible to receive them. The Sacrament of Marriage will be changed and marriage will be available in a different form. The only way to receive the True Sacraments at that stage will be through the Remnant Church.</p>
<p>To My sacred servants who will suffer in My Name, as they will struggle to hold onto the Sacraments and the Holy Mass, know this. Your duty is to Me, through your Holy Vows, and you must never be tempted to deviate from the Truth. Pressure will be put on you to desert the ways of the Lord. Your voice will become just like a whisper as the enemy tries to drown out  the True Word of God.</p>
<p>Gather together. Unite. For very soon the Temple of God will be desecrated beyond recognition. All  you need do is follow Me, listen to your heart and your conscience. Be ready at all times, for this difficult journey ahead. You will need all your courage, your strength and your perseverance.<br>
Know that, at the end of your journey, I will be waiting to sweep  you into My Holy Arms and into the safe haven of My New Paradise.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
