		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, the sun is one of the greatest signs when divine intervention is about to be unveiled. <strong>When you see changes in the sun; when it seems larger; shines longer and out of season; know that the time is getting closer for My Second Coming.</strong></p>
<p>The Hand of God will use the sun to alert the world that its activity is unusual. Scientists will be unable to give a reason for sudden movements in the sun and for the unusual behaviour of this star, which brings you light. Without the light of the sun the earth would be plunged into darkness. So, as the sins of man increase, and sin is embraced as simply part of human nature,  the earth will be covered with the spirit of darkness.  <strong>As sin envelops the world, the sun will slowly lose its lustre and become dull. As man loses his sense of love for others and becomes immune to the pain he inflicts upon others, because of sin, the world will become darker – darker of the spirit, darker by day.</strong></p>
<p>I will continue to lead God’s children up to this time. I will show you the way to My Kingdom and you will see My Light. Nothing will distract you along the way because you will see clearly how evil brings with it a terrible darkness.</p>
<p><b>The sun will dissipate until finally, no light will cover the earth for three days</b>. The only light will be that which comes from the Truth. And, on the fourth day, the skies will burst open and the light – the likes of which you will never have believed possible will pour from the Heavens. Then I will be seen by every person in every country, at the same time, in all My Glory, as I come to reclaim the Kingdom promised to Me by My Father.</p>
<p>Never fear the preparation that is required so that each of you is ready to meet Me. You must ensure that you are well prepared for Me because that will be the day when I will hand you the Keys to My Kingdom and there will be great celebrations. Evil will no longer exist in My New World to come, and the righteous shall join in union with Me and all the angels and saints.</p>
<p>You must look on this mission as if you are on a journey. Every part of your journey brings new discoveries – ways in which you will learn what is needed to prepare you for the next stage. As you climb each hurdle you will become stronger. Even the weakest amongst you will complete this journey, for I will lead you on every step you take and soon it will be complete.</p>
<p>Rejoice, for My Kingdom awaits and the time will be short.<br>
Your Jesus</p>
