		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, when I give you the Gift to see God’s children, everywhere you go, through the Eyes of God, it is for a reason.</p>
<p>Every time you see a young child and feel My Love surge through your veins, this is My Love for them. When you see a teenager walking and laughing with his friends and feel a surge of maternal love for him, then know that this is the Love of God you are feeling. When you see older people and still feel this love, this again, is My Love you feel.</p>
<p>When you look at those souls who cause terrible grief upon others, through their wickedness, and you feel pity for them, know too, that this is My Love, which courses through you. <strong>Know that those who defy Me in every way, still fill Me with Love for them, for how could I deny them? They are Mine. I love them.</strong> <strong>I cry for them. I pine for them. I Am sick with worry for them.</strong> How they cause Me such terrible pain, but I will fight the evil one, right to the very last breath they take on this Earth, for these sorry souls.</p>
<p>What is given life by My Father is His. What is His is Mine. I died for them, even though they cursed Me. They still do. I pine for them. Without them I cannot feel whole. This is why I would gladly go through My Crucifixion again and again if I could draw them into My Arms.</p>
<p>How can I rest, My daughter, without the sweetness of their conversion? But, they must come to Me of their own free will. I can cover them with My Love and Graces. I can flood their souls with every Grace, but in order for them to accept such Gifts, they will have to succumb to My Holy Will and surrender to Me. I cannot use My Divinity to impose My Will on them, but what I can do, through My Father’s Generosity, is to take My chosen souls and ask them to take on My Pain, in return for these souls. This miraculous intervention will be one of the ways in which I can save most of humanity.</p>
<p>Pray, My beloved daughter, to Me, your Jesus, for the strength to give Me more suffering. If you accept this special request, I solemnly promise that I will save tens of millions more souls. Do not be frightened. You will be strong and you will do this with joy in your heart this time.</p>
<p>Go, My daughter, accept My Request. Do not fear it, for you will bring Me the greatest joy if you hand Me over these new trials. It will be I, Who will endure the pain, not you. Your pain will be brief, but by accepting it, I can achieve My desire to salvage My poor children, who are separated from Me.</p>
<p>Thank you for responding to My Call. Open your heart to My request and I will help you every step of the way. For you, this will be simply another trial and soon, easily forgotten. For Me, it means souls, who would have gone to Hell, will be Mine in My Kingdom.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
