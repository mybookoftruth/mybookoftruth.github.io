		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, it will not be long now before all prophesies foretold will be unveiled before a disbelieving world.</p>
<p>Even those unclean souls who shun Me, their Divine Saviour and My Eternal Father, will not fail to notice. They will wonder why this is happening and for the first time will finally realise that they do not control their own destiny.</p>
<p>For all their misguided beliefs and their perceived right to personal gain, they will soon realise the Truth.</p>
<p>My daughter, the way forward is to pray that these souls, however lost to Me, do not follow the allure of the antichrist and the false prophet.</p>
<p>Very soon a man will come who will profess to be Me. But of course, this cannot be, for I will not come until the very end.</p>
<p>Yet he will display all the qualities that will deceive poor souls into believing that it is I.</p>
<p>He will perform wonders; great acts of peace, humanitarian deeds and acts of public affection.</p>
<p>He will be idolised and his powers will come from Satan, the king of darkness. So convincing will he be, that when he displays signs associated with the great saints, many of My sacred servants will drop in humility at his feet.</p>
<p><strong>My Word, given to you, the true end time prophet, will be rejected and dismissed as heresy.</strong></p>
<p>I give you, My daughter, plenty of warning now so that as many of My children can be given the Truth before this happens.</p>
<p>Do not be fooled by those who exalt themselves in your eyes as being holy. Never confuse humanitarian deeds as always coming from Me.</p>
<p>The evil one is a liar. He is cunning and will present, at times, <strong>a loving charitable exterior</strong>.</p>
<p>Watch for those organizations, which are fronted by very wealthy individuals who boast about their efforts to save humanity. Many of them work in secret to denounce My Word.</p>
<p>This type of deception, will be used by the antichrist to recruit well-meaning, but gullible, followers.</p>
<p><strong>Once seduced you will become trapped.</strong> Then you will be fooled into accepting the <strong>mark of the beast</strong>, which you must avoid at all costs or you will become lost to Me, forever.</p>
<p>Be on your guard at all times.</p>
<p>Your task is simple. Remember there is only One God, Three Persons in the Blessed Trinity, God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Anything else that is presented to you otherwise, does not exist.</strong></p>
<p>Your beloved Saviour</p>
<p>Jesus Christ</p>
