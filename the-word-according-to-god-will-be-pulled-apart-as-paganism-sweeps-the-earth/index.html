		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, <b>the climb to Mount Calvary My Church on Earth has to endure has begun, as foretold.</b> All those who speak in My Name, who love Me and who honour My Teachings, will now have to face this torturous journey in order to uphold My Holy Word.</p>
<p>The Word according to God will be pulled apart as paganism sweeps the Earth. To all of those who follow Me, I say walk with your heads held high. Never waiver  from the Truth when those including your family and friends, plead with you to turn away from My Holy Word, given to you during My time on Earth. You must not weaken your resolve to remain loyal to Me. Some of you will be strong during the journey of persecution. Others will fall. Some will give up. Others will decide to accept the lies presented as Holy Doctrine and will be separated from Me.</p>
<p><strong>I will carry all those on My Shoulders who trust in Me completely. I will grant protection to all those who are brave enough to continue to offer the Holy Mass in the way in which it is meant to be conducted. I will protect the Sacraments presented by those holy sacred servants of Mine who refuse to budge or leave My Service. Those who pledge themselves to My Care will have nothing to worry about. </strong>Those who have been given the Truth all of their lives, and reject My Teachings, in favour of lies, will be cast away from Me. My Justice is to be feared, for let no man believe that they can delve into an abyss of deceit without remorse in their souls and not suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>My Love will be strong enough to embrace those who will be confused during these times. I will reach out to all of God’s children who seek Me out, no matter how blackened their souls are.  In the midst of the turmoil, I will make myself known at last and My Spirit will sweep the Earth just as people believe that they cannot take any more.</p>
<p>Remember that I Am the First and the Last, nothing can conquer Me, I Am All-Powerful and when you feel that the wickedness inflicted upon the world by the enemies of God is overwhelming, that I Am here. I allow for this suffering, this final persecution, because it is the final weapon against the beast. Without it, he would steal the souls of the majority of the world’s population.</p>
<p>This battle for souls will shock those who truly know Me because the wickedness you will have to bear witness to will be seen in men you believe to be good. Satan will leave no stone unturned and he will use every soul, especially those who are close to Me, in order to turn their backs on My Teachings. While the battle will rage for a time, I will, through this Mission, save billions through conversion.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
