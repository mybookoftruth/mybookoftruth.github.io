		<p>I come to you this evening, My dearly beloved daughter, to tell humanity that all is now in My Most Holy Hands.</p>
<p>I refer to the plans underway by the global group, who want to control your currency, your healthcare systems and your sovereignty.</p>
<p>They will not be allowed to control you and My Father’s Hand will fall swiftly, should they try to hurt you, children.</p>
<p>All believers who have My Eternal Father’s Seal of Protection, the Seal of the Living God, will come to no harm.</p>
<p>This is why you, My daughter, must ensure that as many of God’s children are given immediate access to this, instantly, in every corner of the Earth.</p>
<p>Your prayers, children, have been very powerful and especially those of you who recite My Crusade Prayers, My <a href="/divine-mercy-chaplet/">Divine Mercy</a> and the <a href="/how-to-pray-the-rosary/">Holy Rosary</a> daily.</p>
<p>Already they have delayed and prevented a nuclear war, saved millions of souls from the fires of Hell, as well as prevented many earthquakes.</p>
<p>Never forget that it is your prayers, which are your greatest weapon against evil.</p>
<p>Your love for Me, Jesus Christ, has spread because of your allegiance to Me.</p>
<p>You, children, are My modern day disciples and you have now been given the authority and the Gift of the Holy Spirit to spread My Most Holy Word.</p>
<p>In order to receive the Power of the Holy Spirit, you must invoke My help, so that you will speak the Truth at all times when proclaiming My Holy Word.</p>
<p><b>Crusade Prayer (39) is now being Gifted to you so that you can walk amongst all of God’s children and help them to prepare their souls for the New Paradise and My Second Coming.</b></p>
<p><strong><em>“O Jesus, my beloved Saviour, I ask You to cover me with Your Holy Spirit, so that I can speak with authority Your Most Holy Word, to prepare all God’s children for Your Second Coming.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I beseech You, Lord Jesus, for all the Graces that I need, so I can reach out to all faiths, creeds and nationalities, wherever I go. Help me to speak with Your Tongue, soothe poor souls with Your Lips and love all souls with the special Divine Love, which pours out from Your Sacred Heart.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Help me to save souls so close to Your Heart and allow me to console You, dear Jesus, when lost souls continue to reject Your Mercy.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Jesus, I Am nothing without You, but with Your generous aid, I will fight in Your Name to help save the whole of humanity. Amen.”</em></strong></p>
<p>My Army, which has emerged from these My Holy Messages, has reached seven hundred thousand souls already.</p>
<p>Help Me to convert more of God’s children, so that not one soul is lost to Satan at the time of Judgment.</p>
<p>I will keep you strong in all your work for Me, children.</p>
<p>I love you, My precious Remnant Church.</p>
<p>Your beloved Jesus</p>
