		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, I wish to give encouragement to all of you who believe in Me and My Messages contained within this Book – The Book of Truth.</p>
<p>When man follows Me and offers himself to Me, he must emulate all of My Traits. This means that he must love all in My Name and treat every man as he would expect to be treated himself. However, <strong>when you truly abandon yourself into My Care, you will suffer for this.</strong> <strong>You will be treated with cruelty and every attempt will be made to pour scorn upon you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I say this to all of God’s children and to Christians, in particular, for your load is the heaviest.</strong> I call out to all of those in the world who believe in Me, irrespective as to whether or not they believe that I speak to them through these Messages.</p>
<p>Christians will always be targeted by those who want to change God’s Laws to fit into their sinful pursuit of pleasure and selfish desires. The Catholic Church is now about to enter the worst persecution in its history and it will be turned upside down and inside out. <strong>The attack has been planned for decades and carefully constructed.</strong> How the saints in Heaven weep at the catastrophic events which will now unfold at a speed which will shock even those who do not believe in these Messages.</p>
<p><strong>Confusion will result, as many sacred servants will become powerless as everything they held dear will be questioned and then overturned.</strong> They will be challenged and bullied in My Name from within their own ranks.</p>
<p>To those of you who are loyal to My Church on earth, I urge you to be vigilant and to uphold My Teachings if you wish to stay true to Me.  You must never accept anything other than the Truth you have been taught. Soon you will feel very alone and My poor sacred servants will become distressed for their loyalty to Me and to the Church laid down by Peter will be pulled from under them.</p>
<p>To all those who are traditional loyal Christians, you must stay firm and you must not accept any attempt to encourage you to abandon your faith.   You will be pushed to one side and forced to agree to educate your children in a false doctrine, not of God.</p>
<p><strong>These events will now commence</strong> and I warn you of these in order to guide you. Anyone who accuses Me, through this Mission, of encouraging souls to desert My Church on earth does not understand My Instructions. I Am simply asking you to remain loyal to My Teachings when you will find that you are forced to accept a new version of the Church. This new version will not ever be accepted in the Eyes of God.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
