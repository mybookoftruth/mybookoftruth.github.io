		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, I call out to My beloved followers, at this special time, to come to Me and allow Me to cover them with My Precious Blood. I gave up My Life on earth as a token of My Great Mercy and I will move the mountains, the oceans and shake the earth as I come, once again, to bring all of you to Me.</p>
<p>I love you and bring you great Blessings and comfort as I prepare you for my Time. Allow your hearts to welcome Me. Allow My Love for you to infiltrate the hearts of all God’s children including those who persecute you in My Holy Name. I bring you peace this Christmas and assure you that My Time is very near.  I will come soon to reveal to you My Mercy. To those of you who despise Me through this Mission I will pierce your hardened hearts with the Gift of the Holy Spirit. Soon, any doubts you may have will flee and your burden will be lifted. Until then, you will endure the pain of separation from Me, which has been imposed upon you by the king of lies, who rejoices at your rejection of Me. Do not resist Me, My beloved ones, for I love you with a relentless longing. It is with a bitter sweetness that I come to you, begging those of you who say you love Me, to turn to Me. I cry tears of sorrow because you cannot accept Me through this divine intervention when it is given to you freely. You should be trying to proclaim the Truth but, instead, you have rejected Me cruelly and in a way that is not befitting of My Divinity.</p>
<p><strong>The Day when I come in My Divine Mercy will be the day of enlightenment. You will know immediately that I have taken you into a time of complete abandonment, when nothing you have done can be hidden from you. For every act of weakness on your part, you will feel the pain of My Suffering, which will become your own. The remorse you will feel will only be as strong as the faith you have in Me. So many of you will realise what you need to do  to gain My Acceptance. However some of you will deny the Illumination of Conscience because of the distance you have placed between us.</strong></p>
<p>To the proud and the arrogant among you, who will hide your faces from Me during The Warning, I have this to say. Do not be afraid for you are Mine. Because you are a child of God, created in His Image, I will show you great Mercy. Fear not the one who loves you – fear only the one who despises you for he, the evil one, is your greatest enemy. Reject Me and you will become enslaved by My greatest adversary  but if you reject him, My Power will encompass you, protect you and bring you safely into My Kingdom  I give you this information so that you will know that when I say that this will happen, it will happen. And when that Day comes you must remember My Words. Do not fear Me, for what is there to fear? If I gave up My Life for you, why then would you want to give up your life to the devil who seeks only the destruction of your immortal soul?</p>
<p>There is only one way you can turn and that is to Me, your Loving Saviour and Redeemer. I Am your safety net. Do not run away from your salvation. Remember, always, My Compassion, My Love and `my Great Mercy. My Divine Mercy is there for the taking.</p>
<p>Your Beloved Jesus</p>
