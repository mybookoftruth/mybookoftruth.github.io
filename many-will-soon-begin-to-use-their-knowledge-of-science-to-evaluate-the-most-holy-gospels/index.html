		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, many will soon begin to use their knowledge of science to evaluate the Most Holy Gospels. Instead of declaring the Truth of My Word, which comes from the Wisdom of God, they will start to twist it so as to give it a more modern image.</p>
<p><strong>All of My Words, contained in the Holy Gospel, will be interpreted differently. They will say My Word means something new, which will be more relevant in the world today. They will try to give examples as to how I would teach you, were I to walk the Earth at this time</strong>. Gone will be the simplicity of the Word of God, which is for everyone. Those who are intelligent, knowledgeable and who are proud of man’s progress in the world of science, will then begin to make insulting statements.</p>
<p><strong>The Church will embrace so-called new scientific discoveries, which will discredit what is contained in the Holy Bible. They will reveal what they say will be new evidence, which casts doubt as to how the world was created.</strong> They will then say that much of what is contained in the Bible are simply metaphors designed to create peace amongst men. <strong>They will use the message of humanism, love of one another, in terms of your ability to look after the poor, uneducated and needy, as a substitute for the Truth you were given in the Gospels.</strong> Then, the false new doctrines which will seem similar to the Truth, will be embraced by priests, and only those who remain firm to My Word will keep the Truth alive.</p>
<p>My beloved followers, when you find that very few will listen anymore to the Truth – the Word of God – then you must comfort each other. You must continue to remind those in My Churches, who will applaud the heresies, which will be introduced, of the Truth for many of them will be none the wiser. So far will they fall away from Me, that they will readily accept such changes. It will be much easier for those with little faith to accept the word of those who demand reformation, than to remain true to the Word of God.</p>
<p><strong>The call for the first changes will be made soon. With a sweetness that will soothe and passionate talk about the need to rise up as one united world – to show love and tolerance for all – you will be led into the greatest error.</strong> Many will be shocked at how quickly My Church will seem to embrace the secular world. Many will be enthralled at the way in which different religions, pagans and heretics, will scramble to join this new, one world charitable church. They will say: “At last a church which is tolerant has reached out to all.” No longer will they feel ashamed to show disobedience to God. Instead, they will proudly proclaim that their wretched sins are not only acceptable in the Eyes of God, but they are no longer deemed to be sins at all. This will create great rejoicing everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>For the first time in history, those who lead My Church into error will be loved, adored and virtually no criticism leveled upon them.</strong></p>
<p>The greatest heresy, not seen since My death on the Cross, will now devour My Church on Earth. <strong>They will fill My Churches with insulting pagan symbols and I will be nowhere to be seen.</strong> And while they fill the buildings, which they created to adore Me, My True Church, comprising of those who remain faithful to the Truth, will become the only True Temple of God, for they will never accept the desecration of My Body. Their faith will enable them to spread the Gospels and keep the Flame of the Holy Spirit alight.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
