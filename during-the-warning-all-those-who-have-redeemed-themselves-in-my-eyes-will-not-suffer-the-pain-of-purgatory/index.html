		<p>When the time comes My dearly beloved daughter for The Warning, a number of signs will be revealed.</p>
<p>I tell you this to remind all God’s children that they must prepare themselves beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>The two stars will collide and many will be fearful. </strong></p>
<p>There is nothing to fear because this is the greatest gift I bring so that not one soul is lost to the fires of Hell.</p>
<p><strong>Then, My Cross, will appear in the skies and not one person will fail to notice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Many will fall down in fear and a great shaking, like an earthquake, will be felt.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then will come the silence.</strong></p>
<p>Always prepare for this day as if it were tomorrow. Seek redemption now and reveal to Me your sins.</p>
<p><strong>Catholic must go to Confession.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For those who are not Catholics they must recite the Crusade Prayer (24) I give to the rest of the world for My Plenary Indulgence.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>This gift of My Plenary Indulgence is for all of God’s children of every creed and offers a great cleansing. Do not reject this Gift. Accept it.</p>
<p><strong>For Catholics who question My Gift and who have begrudgingly criticised My Gift I say this.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Do you  believe that I would not bestow this Sacrament on all of God’s children?</p>
<p>You must be generous of heart and happy that I do this. Do you think that they should not be given such a Gift? If you do then you don’t truly love Me.</p>
<p>Bow your heads and praise God for this wonderful Gift given to mankind to save their souls.</p>
<p><strong>Then, during The Warning, all those who have redeemed themselves in My Eyes will not suffer the pain of Purgatory.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Those who see their sins unveiled before them, as seen through My Eyes, will be shocked.</p>
<p>Many will find it difficult to accept how blackened their souls are.</p>
<p>Those who do and show remorse will ask Me to pardon them. And I will.</p>
<p>But some will not be sorry and will defend, in their heart, the atrocities they committed as they appear before My Eyes. <strong>They won’t repent and will slap Me in the face.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Either way the fires of the purification and suffering will be felt by all sinners</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The length of time will depend on the gravity of their sins.</strong></p>
<p>Those who pull away from Me need your prayers. They will be given more time to turn back to Me and ask Me to forgive them.</p>
<p><strong>But that time could be as short as a day or as long as a few years</strong>.</p>
<p>No one but My Father knows the date of My Second Coming.</p>
<p>The time between the two events will not be as long as you may think.</p>
<p>Finally, My children will realise the time they are living in and accept the Truth.</p>
<p>For those who know the truth now and who believe in Me you have a duty to pray for the souls who will not accept My Mercy.</p>
<p>My daughter, My greatest desire is to save the entire world, including those who are lost to Me.</p>
<p>All the prayers of My followers, who unite as one voice, can help Me to do this.</p>
<p>Go in Love. Trust in Me always for the time is short and the plans for the salvation of humanity rests in the hands of My Eternal Father.</p>
<p>Your Beloved Jesus</p>
