<p><strong>“O dear Jesus, help Your sacred servants to recognize the schism within Your Church, as it unfolds.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Help Your sacred servants to remain firm and true to Your Holy Word.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Never let worldly ambitions cloud their pure love for You.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Give them the Graces to remain pure and humble before You and to honour Your Most Holy Presence in the Eucharist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Help and guide all those sacred servants who may be lukewarm in their love for You and re-kindle the Fire of the Holy Spirit in their souls.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Help them to recognize temptation, placed before them to distract them. Open their eyes, so they can see the Truth at all times.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bless them, dear Jesus, at this time and cover them with Your Precious Blood to keep them safe from harm.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Give them the strength to resist the seduction of Satan, should they be distracted by the allure of denying the existence of sin. Amen.”</strong></p>
<p>My sacred servants are the backbone of My Church.</p>
<p><strong>They are the first in line to face a terrible onslaught of attack from Satan at this time.</strong></p>
<p>Help Me to steer them on the path to salvaging the remnants of My Church as it heads into the schism which will be created by the False Prophet shortly.</p>
<p>Gather together and pray for the unification of My sacred servants who are needed to keep My Church strong in the days which lie ahead.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
