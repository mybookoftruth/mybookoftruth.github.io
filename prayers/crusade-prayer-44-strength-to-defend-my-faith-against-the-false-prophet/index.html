<p><strong>“Dear Jesus, give me the strength to focus on Your Teachings and to proclaim Your Holy Word at all times.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Never allow me to be tempted to idolize the false prophet, who will try to present himself like You.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep my love for You strong.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Give me the Graces of Discernment, so that I will never deny the Truth contained in the Holy Bible, no matter how many lies are presented to me to encourage me to turn my back on Your True Word. Amen.”</strong></p>
