		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, <strong>God’s children need to understand the enormity of the great battle, which is taking place between My beloved Father and the evil one.</strong> So few of you could ever understand the intensity of this great battle, which has already commenced.</p>
<p><strong>The angels in Heaven have begun the final battle to destroy My Father’s enemies on Earth. As the battle rages, it will engulf souls, everywhere. In particular, it will entice the souls of those who are in darkness and who do not truly know Me, to fight against those whose names are in the Book of the Living.</strong> Those who do not know Me, who do not believe in Me, who do not believe in My Father and who do not believe that Satan exists, will watch on the sidelines as the two Christian armies clash on Earth. These two sides will be contained within the Christian Churches. Christians on both sides will suffer the greatest persecution and they will be pulled in every direction to encourage them to desert Me.</p>
<p>Innocent souls will be hurt by the hatred shown to them by God’s enemies and Satan will use both sides as pawns in a hate-filled agenda, which will result in a terrible desolation on Earth. The desolation will be caused by the sins of man and their betrayal of Me. <strong>Their rejection of God, My Father, will be evident when they decide to change the Laws laid down by His Command, so that they can make them acceptable in their sinful lives.</strong> Know that this will result in a terrible punishment.</p>
<p>The Anger of My Father will increase, the more His ungrateful children rise in defiance of His Almighty Covenant. Those who prepare for My Second Coming will be barricaded into a prison of sorts, when they will be forced to swallow lies. Should they refuse to accept the heresies, which will be forced down their throats, they will be cast out of their churches. My Word will soon be forgotten. <strong>Everything, which I warned you about, will occur exactly as I have told you.</strong> Those who are blind to the Truth would rather live a lie, because it will be easier to accept lies, as they will be very appealing in the way in which they will be presented to them.</p>
<p><strong>Heresy will be presented to the masses as part of a new constitution in My Church, which has nothing to do with Me.</strong> All will clamour to accept this, for they did not remain alert to the times, which they were warned about, concerning the lead up to the Great Day. Now you must prepare for this Day. You must walk away when My Divinity is challenged, as it will be in many ways, within My Church on Earth<strong>.</strong> <strong>Engage with My enemies and you will not win. Ignore them. Pray for their souls and prepare your own, for soon it will all be over. </strong></p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
