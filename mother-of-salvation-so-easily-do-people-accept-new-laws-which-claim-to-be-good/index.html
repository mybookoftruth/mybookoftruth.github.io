		<p>My child, your prayers are being answered and my Son will intervene for your special intention. <strong>You must pray for all of those in the world who are being misguided into believing that evil is good.</strong> <strong>This web of deceit has covered humanity to such an extent that many can no longer differentiate between the Laws of God and the wickedness of the evil one when he manifests amongst you.</strong></p>
<p>So easily do people accept new laws, which claim to be good – for the good of all – when, in fact, they disguise mortal sin in the Eyes of God.</p>
<p>The battle rages on between those who uphold the Laws of God and those who desecrate them. Those who publicly uphold the Laws of God are demonized and declared to be cruel and wicked. <strong>The deceit and the lies, which fill those who say they love humanity, are clearly seen when they publicly justify mortal sin.</strong> How cunning is the evil one. So few understand his influence in their lives or how he twists their reasoning.</p>
<p>Be comforted, dear children, in the knowledge that I, the Mother of Salvation, can defeat the evil one amongst your midst. You must call on me every time you feel overcome by the power he exerts in your nations. I will destroy his influence, when you place your request before me.</p>
<p>Please recite this <b>Crusade Prayer (113) To defeat evil in our land</b></p>
<p><i>O Mother of Salvation, come into our midst and cover our land with your protection.</i></p>
<p><i></i><i>Crush the head of the beast and stamp out his wicked influence amongst us.</i></p>
<p><i>Help your poor lost children to stand up and speak the Truth, when we are surrounded by lies.</i></p>
<p><i>Please, O Mother of God, protect our land and keep us strong, so that we can remain loyal to your Son in our time of persecution. Amen.</i></p>
<p><strong>You must never accept arguments, which allow wicked laws to be brought into being, which dictate how you live your lives, which are not according to the Word of God.</strong> When these laws infiltrate your lands, they destroy souls.</p>
<p>Trust in me, the Mother of Salvation, to help salvage the souls of those you love and work amongst. Call on me and I promise that I will cover your nation with my Most Holy Mantle.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
