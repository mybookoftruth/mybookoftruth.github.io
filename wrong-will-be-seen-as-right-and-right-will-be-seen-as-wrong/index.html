		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, when people try to encourage others to sin, they do this in various ways, which may not seem apparent.</p>
<p>The temptation to sin is a seductive one and the victim will always find it difficult to pull away. In the case of theft, the sinner will be attracted to the grand prize, which will be his, should he agree to steal. In the case of physical assault and bodily harm inflicted on another, the victim will be seduced by hatred, presented to him as being a good thing. He will be convinced that he is simply involved in a punishment, which is necessary, in the name of justice. In other cases, the victim will be drawn into committing sin and will see nothing wrong with it, because the allure will be so attractive.</p>
<p>Sin and the temptation to engage in the act will always be presented as being a good thing, harmless, and in many cases will be perceived as being right. Wrong will be seen as right and right will be seen as wrong. Every thing Satan is involved with, and particularly when he tempts man, with every conceivable reason, to turn his back on God, will be back to front. Everywhere Satan is present there will be confusion. Nothing will be as it should be. Nothing good can come from his infestation. Souls who participate in his schemes will, during and after the sin has been committed, suffer from a deep unsettling conscience. The important lesson here is to avoid situations where you are faced with temptation. To do this, you must pray for the strength to remain in a state of Grace.</p>
<p><strong>Let no man ever believe he has enough will power to withstand the pressures placed upon him by the spirit of evil.</strong> When you believe this, you will fall suddenly and unexpectedly. You must remain alert, every minute of every day, for you never know when the evil one is at work. He is very cunning and very careful. For many, they have no idea how Satan works, but one thing is clear. He will bring you nothing but misery and sorrow. <strong>You must, therefore, pray each day the prayer to Saint Michael. </strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Saint Michael, the Archangel, defend us in battle, be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray and do thou O Prince of the Heavenly Host, by the Power of God, cast into Hell Satan and all the evil spirits who roam the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.</i> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Satan and every demon, who roam the Earth, are working, very hard, to take you away from Me at this time – more than any other time since I walked the Earth.</strong> You must keep your eyes on Me and listen to Me, so that I can continue to protect you.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
