		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, My Name is rarely mentioned in the same breath, as those who claim to represent Me  shout blasphemies against God. <b>My death on the Cross will not only be dismissed and not spoken about, but the images of demons will be used as a substitute for My Corpus on the Cross. If it is not Me they killed on the Cross, then who is it?</b> Who are they, who proclaim My Word to the world, but who utter profanities, which spill from their mouths?</p>
<p>Beware of the miracles the men in white robes will claim to perform, as if they are made of My Flesh and blessed with My Spirit. <b>When you see wondrous and seemingly miraculous events take place, know that they are nothing of the sort.</b></p>
<p>You will be told that miracles have been created by the hand of the false prophet. You will then be expected to show great respect and you will be told, at first, that he is a living saint. He will be worshipped, loved and admired and all will say that he is favoured by God. They will believe, in time, that these miracles are taking place to herald My Second Coming.</p>
<p>And then, the beast will appear. And he will honour the first one. And the world will be caught up in terrible confusion. They will be trapped. On the one hand, <b>the false prophet will control all religions in the world</b> and prey on the love of those who know the Truth. Those who do know the Truth, will not reject Me, for theirs is the Kingdom of God. <b>The antichrist will show great honour towards the false prophet. But, because his role will be a political one, their allegiance will unite many people who will applaud this alliance.</b></p>
<p>These events will begin to make sense soon. Those who try to take you away with them into a false faith, not of God, will be very convincing. They will never reveal their true intent, until they believe they are winning this battle. But then, they will destroy many, who refuse to accept the mark of the beast. <strong>They will say that this will be a sign of true world peace, love and unity, but hidden within its vile core will be the number 666, the sign of the beast.</strong></p>
<p>Just as holy medals offer protection from Heaven with Power from God, the mark of the beast will bring with it death – death of the soul and death by a terrible disease. Those who refuse it will have to hide and prepare. I know this is frightening, but it is true. I will intervene with the help of your prayers to put an end to the persecution.</p>
<p><b>You, my beloved followers, who know the Truth, are being prepared to help those who will struggle with this knowledge. By the time this happens, My Remnant Army, will be a force to be reckoned with.</b> Their strength will lie in their ability to save those who will suffer by this diabolical act of revenge on God’s children.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
