		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, you must know, by now, that the suffering you endure, in My Name, will continue until the very last day of this Mission.</p>
<p>This is difficult for you to hear, but know this. This Mission is the most difficult of all the Missions, which came before you. You will be cast into the wilderness and you will feel isolated and lonely. Your voice will be ignored, but My Holy Word will touch the hearts of millions.</p>
<p>My Holy Will, will be heeded by you at all times, although you often feel that you will not be strong enough.</p>
<p>Your weakness is your strength, because of your trust in Me. Because of this I will never desert you or leave you without the help of others. Yet, you will walk alone in this Mission. Your only companion will be Me. I conjoin our suffering as one.</p>
<p>You, My daughter, will always need My Graces of endurance. To endure this Mission, and proclaim My Holy Word to an ungrateful world, will not be easy. It will require a great sense of determination and courage.</p>
<p><strong>This applies to all of My disciples, including those who love Me, but who do not accept these Messages.<br>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>The obstacles you will face, at this part of the Mission will increase for all of you, My devoted army.</strong></p>
<p>You must accept, with dignity, that when you follow Me, that you will suffer. Very few souls can handle the suffering, which affects everyone who aligns themselves with My Teachings.</p>
<p><strong>At this time in the world, the mere mention of a belief in Me, your Jesus, creates embarrassment.</strong></p>
<p>Not only does it cause you discomfort, when your allegiance to Me is declared in public; you will suffer because of Me.</p>
<p>Remember, to suffer is a special grace. It is very difficult to endure and many souls turn away from Me because of it. But you must remember this. When you suffer in My Name, I will hold you and pour over you My Graces. Despite your sufferings, this will bring you a peace of the soul.</p>
<p>Please, My daughter, never give up. Never feel abandoned for I am even closer when you feel alone. I am even closer to you during these times of torment. You must keep asking, for all the help you can, get by requesting My beloved Mother and all the saints to come to your aid.</p>
<p>Very soon you will accept that the increase in suffering is a direct result of the opposition to this Mission by the evil one. He is extremely frightened because his battle is at an end. He hates you because of the souls, which are being saved through this Mission of salvation.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
