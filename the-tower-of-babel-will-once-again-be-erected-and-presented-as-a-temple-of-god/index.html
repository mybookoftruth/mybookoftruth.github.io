		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, who can deny My death on the Cross? Who can deny that I gave up My Life so that the Truth would save sinners everywhere?  Then who amongst you will, when the time comes, deny the Truth of My Church on earth when it is taken apart stone by stone?</p>
<p>You have been given the Truth. You know My Teachings. So then, you will know My Church by My Teachings. My Church on Earth is the Truth. My Church on Earth is My Body. So if a man amongst you scourges My Body, then re-invents My Teachings and then presents to you lies, will you deny Me then?</p>
<p>I, Jesus Christ, do not tell you this to divide you. I tell you these things so that you will honour My Teachings, uphold the Holy Sacraments and remain firm to the Truth. <strong>No man on earth can change the Teachings of My Church</strong>. No man.<strong> Not one amongst you has been given this authority to declare new doctrines and present them as Mine.</strong> Yet, many amongst you will deny Me by denying the Truth, given to you 2,000 years ago. So lacking are you, in the knowledge of sacred things, that you will be ignorant of the new laws, which will blaspheme against Me, when they are introduced into My Church on Earth.</p>
<p>Just as it was before, the Tower of Babel will, once again, be erected and presented as a temple of God. It will be located in Rome and will feature the new symbol of the new one world religion. This symbol will be seen on the roof, at the entrance, and will take precedence on the high altar within. My precious Tabernacle in gold, defiled in all its Glory, will sit in the centre of the altar for all to see. This insult will mean that the beast will be given the open door to invade My Tabernacle. My Presence will, at this time, disappear.</p>
<p>Millions of people – many of whom will not know the significance of this abomination – will do everything asked of them and they will pray before the beast. New garments, produced with gold emblems, which will have the appearance of humble cassocks, will be worn by those who serve in this so-called temple.  The gold emblem, which will be displayed in a  brazen manner, will be the symbol of the new world religion.</p>
<p><strong>Crosses will disappear.</strong> My Crucifix will be nowhere to be seen. Then, where they are seen, in some public places, people will be forced, by law, to take them down.</p>
<p>The new tower, which will honour Satan, will be replicated in many countries and then the second part of the deceit will be made known. <strong>The existence of Hell will be publicly declared, by the church, to be nonsense.</strong> People will be lulled into a false sense of security when this blatant lie is accepted by all churches. It will be argued that God would never allow for such a place to exist. That He loves all and that the existence of Hell was spread by religious fanatics down through the centuries. And so,<strong> people will condone even the existence of mortal sin</strong>. Sin will be so widely accepted that people will no longer pray or ask for Mercy, for it will not be God they will acknowledge. It will be to the beast they will surrender their souls and every step of their journey will be carefully orchestrated by the enemies of God.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
