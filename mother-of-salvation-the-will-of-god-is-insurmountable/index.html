		<p>My dear children do not be afraid of the Promises of Christ for they will be your redeeming factor. My Son, Jesus Christ, is present amongst you and He will never desert you or leave your side. His Promise to salvage the world will be completed, as it is the Will of my Eternal Father.</p>
<p>You must know that the Will of God is insurmountable, and no matter how great the obstacles are, which are placed before you, God, through His Divinity, will crush all His enemies. You must never think that evil will triumph because this is impossible. Through the great Love of God, you will be guided towards Eternal Salvation and nothing will succeed in blocking your way. When my Son’s enemies try to force you to accept laws, which are not from God, then you must resist these. It may be difficult for you but you will be given the strength to continue on your journey and, every kind of help from Heaven will be given to you.</p>
<p>Learn to recognise the work of the evil one by the wars you see arising everywhere; the wicked laws introduced in almost every nation, which deny the Word of God; and the betrayal of Jesus Christ by those who say they represent Him, when they sit back and do nothing to proclaim His Holy Word. Learn also to recognise the hatred shown to God’s chosen souls because then you will know the difficult mission, which has been given to them, so they can remind the world that God’s Love is still alive.</p>
<p>You must also give thanks to God the Most High for the Life He gave humanity through His only Son, Jesus Christ.  Were it not, for the birth of my Son, and His Crucifixion there would have been no New Covenant to bring you the glorious life, which awaits you if you so chose to accept it.</p>
<p><strong>These are the times in which to prepare for the new world, the new Heaven and the new earth. Do not waste time trying to argue over what my Son is telling you now. Instead, learn to accept the Truth with good grace. I, your beloved Mother, will guide you towards my Son and your prayers will strengthen you, in every way, so that you may be made worthy of the Promises of Christ.</strong></p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
