		<p>My child, it is important to remember to recite my most Holy Rosary each day in order to protect this mission, and other missions, sanctioned by my Eternal Father for the world.</p>
<p>Christians who uphold the Faith will find it very difficult to continue to declare their devotion to me, the Immaculate Virgin Mary, Mother of God, in these times. My role as the Mother of God’s children is being undermined and discarded and, in particular, by certain Catholic groups who do not come from my Son. Such groups give the impression that they are devotees of my Son’s Church but they do not practice what He taught. <b>They persecute those who uphold the Truth and go to extraordinary lengths to dismiss, as nonsense, every kind of private revelation given to humanity since my Son’s Death on the Cross. </b><strong>Were it not for private revelations, given to the world by me, the Mother of God as Christ’s messenger, many would never have converted to the Truth.</strong>  Instead, many would have continued to walk in the dark, dismissed the Existence of God and avoided prayer – the door that, when opened, enlightens the soul.  My role as the Mother of God is being attacked across the world because of the power I have been given to destroy the wicked adversary. I will crush the head of the serpent as foretold but those who display devotion to me will be scorned and ridiculed by impostors, who dare to proclaim themselves experts in the teachings of the Church.</p>
<p>My Son abhors any kind of hatred shown by man for his brother. He sheds tears when anyone, who says that he represents my Son’s Church,  then incites hatred against a child of God. He suffers the pain of His Crucifixion every time a servant in His Church hurts another or causes terrible suffering to innocents.</p>
<p><b>Children, you must pray hard for my Son’s Church as it is under the greatest attack since its foundation</b>. <b>The enemies of my Son have many plans to destroy it and most of these will come from within. Heed my warning, and those I revealed to the world at Fatima. The enemy awaits and soon he will control, completely, my Son’s Church on earth and millions will be led into error.</b></p>
<p>Close your ears when you hear of my Son’s servants being scorned or slandered for defending the Word of God. Always remember that only love comes from God and any person or organisation that encourages you to cast judgement upon a man – irrespective as to what he has done – is to be questioned.  <strong>You cannot declare  yourself to be a servant of God and then tell the world to cast aspersions upon another person. You can never condone incitement to hatred of any kind.</strong> Any person who does this, in my Son’s Name, must never be encouraged for this could never come from God. My Rosary must be recited as often as possible to crush the evil, which grips the world at a time when cruelty of any kind is deemed to be just.</p>
<p>Man’s love for his brother has become scarce and charity amongst Christians has been diluted.  You must open your eyes to the Truth and remind yourselves what my Son taught you. It is as clear as day, for it was written for the world to read in the most Holy Bible.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
