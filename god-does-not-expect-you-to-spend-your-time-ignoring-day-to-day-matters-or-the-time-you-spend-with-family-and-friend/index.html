		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, when a man begins to believe in his invincibility, he is lost.</p>
<p><strong>So many people, who do not accept that life on Earth is but just a small part of their spiritual journey towards My Kingdom, are wasting so much precious time.</strong> The time I refer to is that given to you by God, in which you must live according to His Commandments, if you are to achieve Eternal Life. If you do not accept God, then you cut yourself away from Him. When you do that, your life will be cut short, and so instead of the Gift of Eternal Life, your life will end when you die in this one. You must not waste the time given to you in this life by spending it chasing useless things, which will be but dust, in time.</p>
<p><strong>God does not expect you to spend your time ignoring day-to-day matters or the time you spend with family and friends.</strong> It does not mean, if you enjoy the fruits of life on Earth, that you cannot adhere to the ways of the Lord. You can.</p>
<p>My daughter, I wish to make it known that there is much confusion as to My wishes for humanity when I desire them to follow My Teachings.</p>
<p><strong>Laughter is good. Companionship is important. Enjoying a fulfilling life is good, once you show humility and praise for God and then offer thanks even for the smallest of pleasures. </strong>Any Gifts you receive in this life, for the good of others, can only come from God. How you use these Gifts will be important in the salvation of your soul, when the Gifts provided by God are shared with others. Some are given great talents, but all souls are born with Gifts. They are meant to help you to help others. Those born with a talent for business, have an obligation to ensure that this is put to good use, for the benefit of others. Others will use their Gifts to care for their neighbor and to bring joy into other people’s lives. And then there are the souls who suffer. Their suffering is also a Gift, for they will help save the souls of others, and by doing so, will gain the greatest Gift of all – Eternal Life.</p>
<p>Life is given by God, for a reason. It is to give Glory to God and to encourage His children to unite with Him, finally, when life will change. <strong>God’s children are being prepared for this change, when finally, the glorious Eternal Life promised to Adam and Eve will become theirs. </strong></p>
<p>It is important to try and show much love and compassion to each other, just as you would expect to be treated by Me, when I come to Judge. Every day you must ask yourself, for every deed you carry out, would this please God? Am I doing enough to follow God’s Commandments? Am I breaking the Laws of God, and if so, what will the consequences be?</p>
<p>Ignore the needs of others and your needs will be ignored. Hurt any of God’s children with deliberate intent and you will suffer. Kill any of God’s children and you will have no life. Life on Earth, although it can bring much love, joy and hope, is full of trials. Each trial must be faced and you must accept that it is part of God’s plan in the purification of His children.</p>
<p>When you live your life without acknowledging God, you are living life to suit your own desires. When you do not set standards, laid down by God, you will lose your way. If you wander so far away that you cannot find your way back, then you must pray for God’s Grace to help you.</p>
<p><strong>Every single request made to God, if it is for the good of your soul and for the needs of those who you love, is always answered.</strong></p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
