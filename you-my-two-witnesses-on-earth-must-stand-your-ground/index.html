		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, My enemies are not contained within the hierarchy of false religions. Many such souls know no better and they will accept Me when I make Myself known to them. It is those who will mastermind the greatest apostasy, from within the ranks of My Own Church on Earth, who are the most dangerous of all.</p>
<p>Not all, who come dressed as My servants, are of Me, but know this. My <strong>Hour is close and just prior to My Second Coming, the plague of apostasy will descend and devour My Church on Earth.</strong> <strong>Just as those wolves in sheep’s clothing, fool the world into believing that the House of God accepts any faith, including those which deny Me, Jesus Christ, they will convince you that this abomination will be the greatest evangelization the world will have ever seen.</strong> And in its wake will incur the Wrath of God. While the world and all its religions will be sucked into this new, false church, the way will be prepared for them to proudly groom the man of lawlessness.</p>
<p>While those of you who remain alert to My Warning and those who will defiantly hold true to My Word suffer, I will also give you the strength to endure this sorrowful event. Those imposters, who will have wangled their way into My Church, will have deceived many and they will continue to deceive millions, including all Christian faiths, as well as those who do not honour Me at all. All of these deceivers will spread heresy and in time, they will form one religion for the world. No other faith will be tolerated, other than the new false doctrine – the doctrine from Hell. <strong>Christians and Jews will be the two faiths from which the Remnant will be formed. </strong></p>
<p>When My Prophecies bring tears to your eyes, know that because I bless you, through this Mission, with nerves of steel and an iron determination, you will remain loyal to Me, your Jesus.</p>
<p>You, My Two Witnesses on Earth, must stand your ground. Resist any temptation to turn away from Me and persist in your love for Me at all times. <strong>My Remnant Church will be formed, both outside of this Mission, as well as from within it.</strong> <strong>Those of you who reject this Mission now, but who genuinely love Me, you too will be drawn into My Remnant Army on Earth. On the day that this happens, you will have realized that the Book of Truth was, indeed, a Gift from Heaven to help you in your final journey to My Kingdom and Eternal Life.</strong> Only then will you rejoice and be fearless, because you will have all the confidence needed to bring glory to God.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
