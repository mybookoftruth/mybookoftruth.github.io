		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, the vision I permitted you to witness last night, was to strengthen your spirituality, and to show you the Truth of life after death.</p>
<p>During the first hours after death, Satan sends his demons to tempt souls – even at that stage.</p>
<p>He tempts them to reject the state of Purgatory. He does the same thing to those, who have died in a state of grace, who are destined for Heaven.</p>
<p>I showed you the speed by which souls plunge into Hell and the terrifying persecution they face, in order to warn those who do not believe it exists.</p>
<p>Billions of souls are there already, and there are so many entering every second, that it appeared to you like a shower of fallen stars, like a hailstorm, falling into the lake of fire.</p>
<p>I showed you also the shock and the joy of those souls faces, when they have been plucked, at the last minute, and saved. This is due to the suffering accepted by victim souls, for the salvation of such souls from Hell.</p>
<p>You saw, first, the terror, and then, the fear in their faces, as the Truth of their final resting place dawns on them. Then you were shown the joy on their faces when they realised that they had been spared.</p>
<p>The billions of souls, already in Hell, are those who rejected Me, shamelessly, during their life on earth. Many were smart, intelligent people, in positions of influence in the world, who went to great lengths to ensure that the Word of God was not heard. Many were responsible for ordering the murder of thousands of innocent people. They executed God’s children without one ounce of remorse in their hearts. They performed vile acts, involving sexual perversities, which are offensive to God and detested by Him.</p>
<p>Many, caused persecution against God’s Churches through secular activities, and in some cases, joined the enemy in black masses, where they worshipped the beast.<br>
These are the souls you are saving, My daughter. Those with blackened souls and hearts of stone.</p>
<p>There are ten times more souls in Hell than in Purgatory. The billions of souls in Hell, all in different levels, outnumber those in Heaven by thirty-three for every single soul.</p>
<p>It is not easy to go to Heaven, and it takes much commitment to prepare your souls to enter the gates.</p>
<p>This is the time of the Truth. The Truth is not always pleasant, but it is necessary for all of God’s children to understand.</p>
<p>My Mercy is, however, great. When you ask for it, for yourselves, your prayers will be answered. When you ask for another soul to be saved, especially at the time of their death, your call will be heard. If you do not ask for My Mercy, it cannot be given.</p>
<p>At the time of The Warning, My Mercy will be poured all over the earth. Then you must ask Me for My Great Mercy, to protect you.</p>
<p>To those who reject My Mercy, this will be by their own free will.</p>
<p>My Mercy is plentiful, yet so few ask for it.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
