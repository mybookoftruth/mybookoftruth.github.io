		<p>My dear children of God, <strong>you must never forget how special you are in God’s Eyes, for He loves you all unconditionally. How He loves you is beyond your comprehension</strong>. He smiles when you smile. He laughs when you laugh. He weeps when you are blighted with pain and sorrow and He becomes enraged when you suffer persecution at the hands of others.</p>
<p><strong>At this time in history, when hatred infests nations everywhere and when innocents are tortured, oppressed and killed, His Hand will reach out and punish the wicked.</strong> <strong>When humanity defies God by showing no regard for the Laws of God and, in particular, respect for the life of another human being, His Punishment will engulf the world.</strong> He, who shows no respect for human life, does not acknowledge God or His Divinity.</p>
<p><strong>God is the Creator and Author of Life – He gives it and only He has the Authority to take it away.</strong> Oh how much sorrow there is at this time in His heavenly Kingdom, because of the aggression, which is fuelled by the evil one, against His Creation.</p>
<p>You must ask God to alleviate the suffering, which is caused in the world by men whose hearts are cold, angry and full of hatred. <strong>Those who inflict terror on others need your prayers.</strong> Please recite this Prayer to protect the weak and the innocent and to alleviate the horrors which man has to endure at this time.</p>
<p><b>Crusade Prayer (162) To protect the weak and the innocent:</b></p>
<p><i>O God, Father Almighty, please protect the weak and the innocent, who suffer at the hands of those with hatred in their hearts. Alleviate the suffering endured by Your poor helpless children. </i></p>
<p><i>Give them all the Graces they need to protect themselves from Your enemies. Fill them with courage, hope and charity, so that they can find it in their hearts to forgive those who torment them. </i></p>
<p><i>I ask You, dear Lord, my Eternal Father, to forgive those who defy the Law of Life and help them to see how much their actions offend You, so that they can amend their ways and seek solace in Your Arms. Amen.</i></p>
<p><strong>Children, pray, pray, pray for the protection of those who suffer because of their allegiance to God, the Eternal Father, and for those who are the victims of cruel and senseless wars. </strong></p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
