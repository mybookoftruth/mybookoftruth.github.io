		<p>My dearest daughter, <strong>man is in control of his own destiny, because he has been given freedom of choice, as a Gift from Me.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Some choose the correct path towards My heavenly Kingdom, which is through My Only-Begotten Son, Jesus Christ.</strong> Others choose unwisely.<strong> Because of man’s gifts, which include intelligence, knowledge and free will, many become proud. Others seek falsehoods and great material gifts, which the world makes possible, until eventually, only their immediate desires become important to them.</strong> By adhering to selfish acts and deeds; by becoming self-obsessed and by seeking out personal fulfillment, at the expense of others, they condemn themselves to the sins, which will enslave them.</p>
<p>By refusing to accept the Gift of Eternal Life, which I bring to all of you, who will share in My Kingdom, you, dear children, will separate from Me for eternity. I come to intervene at this time because the self-absorption in the world has eradicated all love in your hearts for Me. <strong>I come to bring you the Truth; the knowledge of My Kingdom and a reminder of the two choices, which you will be presented with. The first choice is to accept My Hand of Mercy and live a glorious life by sharing in the Divine Life of My New Kingdom. The second choice is to choose eternal darkness and become slaves to the abyss, where Satan will remain forever. </strong></p>
<p>So many of you refuse My Love, the knowledge I gave you through My Holy Word, and the warnings given to you by the prophets. Do not believe that the world today is any different to time on Earth up to now. Humanity has not changed. Sin is still your curse and it will only be by fighting the enemy – which brings you misery and sorrow – that you will become capable of accepting the Life I have created for you.</p>
<p>Listen now as I remind you of My Promise.<strong> I have created an Eternal Paradise, which belongs to you. It will provide you with Eternal Life of the body and the soul. It awaits you.</strong> Do not squander your inheritance. This will break My Heart if you do and you will regret this decision for eternity.</p>
<p><strong>Hear now My Call</strong>, for I will send every sign; every Miracle and every Grace, so as to awaken your jaded hearts until I stir, within you, the knowledge of the Truth.</p>
<p><strong>I Am the Truth. Take My Hand and follow Me. All Life comes from Me.</strong></p>
<p>Your Eternal Father</p>
<p>God the Most High</p>
