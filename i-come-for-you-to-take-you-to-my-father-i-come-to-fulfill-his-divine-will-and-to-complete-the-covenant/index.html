		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, when you find this Work difficult and hesitate to give the world bad news, you must understand that you are only the messenger. You are an instrument of the Holy God, the Most High and it is your duty to respond to His Call. Your obedience is essential and you must not fear the repercussions, which may befall you as a prophet of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>All events foretold have been laid down in the beginning and form part of God’s Plan to complete the Covenant to gather His children, finally, so that they can live in harmony in His Divine Will.</strong> The final battle between My Father’s hierarchy and the evil one means that many people, who leave themselves exposed, will become infested by sin and will turn against their brothers who remain loyal to God.</p>
<p>When the battle is being fought many wicked atrocities will be carried out, by the enemies of God, against His beloved children. But as I have told you before, they can only go so far, because they do not have the power to destroy humanity, although they believe that they do.</p>
<p><strong>Take comfort, all of you, because My Father will intervene with the wicked actions of those who want to control all nations and He will strike them dead – those who dare to hurt His children</strong>. Many poor souls will suffer during such persecutions, but My Father is ever-merciful. His Power cannot be touched. His Hand is Almighty. He can, at any time, cast away His enemies. But the prophecies foretold, and which must take place before My Second Coming, are a reality. They will unfold in a way, which may not be obvious to all of you, but know this. Prayer is your weapon. Prayer will provide you with the armour you need to defeat the evil one. Prayer will dilute the impact of war, suffering and every kind of persecution inflicted upon the human race by the enemies of God. Prayer will save you and all those for whom you pray. Your prayers will destroy evil and when the Great Day comes you will cry tears of joy when you witness the New Generation, those billions of people who have been salvaged because of your response to My Call.</p>
<p>While My Messages bring a mixture of sadness, fear, frustration – they also bring hope because they create much conversion. My Father’s Plan is unknown to most of you. What you need to understand is this. His Plan will destroy all His enemies. By allowing all these trials to take place, He will free the human race, at last, from its bondage to sin. Be patient. Be calm. For soon joy, love and peace will finally be yours for eternity.</p>
<p>I come only because we are as one – one holy family in God’s Kingdom. I come for you to take you to My Father. I come to fulfill His Divine Will and to complete the Covenant. I come to bring you the Truth.</p>
<p>Your loving Saviour</p>
<p>Jesus Christ</p>
