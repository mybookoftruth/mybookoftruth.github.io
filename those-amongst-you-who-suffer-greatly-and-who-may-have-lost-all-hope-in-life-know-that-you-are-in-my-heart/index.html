		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, My Heart yearns for the world and everyone who lives in it and I promise you that I will do everything to unite all of you, God’s children, within My Heart.</p>
<p>I love every man, woman and child, no matter who they are – whether they are powerful, rich, influential, humble, poor or just simple people, living ordinary lives. All of you were chosen to be born by My Father, Who created you. Each soul has a purpose and every one of you is a cherished child of God.</p>
<p><strong>Those amongst you, who suffer greatly and who may have lost all hope in life, know that you are in My Heart and that I feel your pain deeply. I suffer within you.</strong> <strong>You must never give up hope, because I have a place for you in My Paradise.</strong> When you give up hope, you are turning your back on your future, which is full of My Light. This future is My Gift to you and all is Mine. <strong>I will take away your worry. Just call to Me and say: “Jesus, take my terrible pain and suffering away and let me feel Your Love.” and I will lift your heavy burden instantly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you feel empty and believe that no one truly loves you, you must know that I Am there beside you, because I will always love you, no matter how far away you have strayed.</strong> When you believe that you have nothing to live for, then know that My New Paradise will give you Eternal Life. But you must persevere with your suffering in this life first. Yet, I will ease your suffering and all you have to do is ask Me to.</p>
<p>Many of you feel worthless, unloved, unsuccessful, unfulfilled and of little use. You feel like this because the world is obsessed with so-called success and ambitions. Only the few, the elite, seem to achieve such great heights. The pressures created by the world’s media to celebrate wealth and beauty only serve to destroy the confidence of ordinary man. It is not necessary to impress others. It is not necessary or desirable to impress Me with your so-called success. Work hard, by all means. Use the talents given to you by God, but use them in order to serve others and for the good of all. <strong>But know this. It is the weak, the humble of spirit and those with a simple love for Me, Jesus Christ, whom I will raise up to the greatest glory in My Kingdom. Those who suffer now will never suffer again in My New Paradise.</strong></p>
<p>My Promise to come to gather you all will be fulfilled during My Second Coming. Look to this day with longing and joy, for it is not far away and then I will bring you the Gifts of love, joy, happiness and Eternal Life. Persevere and come close to Me. I Am with you. I will never desert you, but you must not separate yourself from Me because if you do, you will be lost to Me. Come, lay your head upon My Shoulder. Let Me comfort you. Let Me put an end to your sorrow. Let Me wipe your tears away. Let Me grant you My Peace.</p>
<p><strong>I grant you a special Blessing now. Take it. Accept My Hand and all will be well. I love you.</strong></p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
