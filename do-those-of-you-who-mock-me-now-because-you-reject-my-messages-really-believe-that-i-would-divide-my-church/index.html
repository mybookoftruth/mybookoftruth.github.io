		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, at last, you offer Me thanks for this very difficult Mission. I know how much pain it causes you to proclaim the Word of God, because it creates much anger amongst those who believe they are the elite.</p>
<p>My daughter, know that while I grant you favours, you will always walk alone and you will end up in the wilderness, just like the prophets before you. I will send some to help you, but you will always be isolated. But I will always keep you company, while the wolves will hunt you down.</p>
<p><b>Tell those who call themselves My true disciples, priests and sacred servants, amongst you, this. I will always hear the voices of the little, the weak, the humble and those pure of heart. Even if they are frightened of My Messages, I will always favour those who truly love Me. Who are these I speak of now? I refer to those who have never forgotten what I told them. Carry My Cross, follow Me, but be prepared, for when you declare the Word of God without malice, you will suffer My Pain. No matter how civilized you believe the world to be at this time, you will be hated when you stand up, defiantly, against those who hate Me. When they hate Me, they will crucify you.</b><b></b></p>
<p>I listen to the meek. I bless those who carry out My clear instructions to you, to love one another, no matter how they torment you. Those of you who reject Me, through these Messages, must never, because of your doubts, spread hatred against anyone in My Name. I, Jesus Christ, tell you now that the devil has come to declare this final assault on all of God’s children. Those of you who refuse to listen to Me, will fall for the charm of his devout servants.</p>
<p>Don’t you know that My Church will be attacked by Satan and that this has been foretold? My enemies will walk amongst you and, yet, you do not accept that I would allow this. Know that the Battle of Armageddon comprises of two sides. Those who believe in God and follow the Word of God and the evil one, his army and all those he deceives. Satan will deceive many in My Church and only those who remain alert and who watch out for doctrinal errors, will be able to withstand the seduction. The seduction is the most powerful tool used by the deceiver. He deceives by appearing to proclaim the Truth.</p>
<p>I urge those poor souls, those who love Me and who remain true to My Church on Earth, to listen. <b>You must remain true to My Church and accept discipline, when your superiors remain true to what I gave the world, through My death on the Cross. The time for choice is close. The abomination has not happened yet, but when you see the errors, which go against My Teachings and My Gift of the Sacraments, walk away. That day is close. Then you must gather and continue to follow the Rules of My Church, as they were laid down before you by Peter.</b><b></b></p>
<p>Do those of you who mock Me now, because you reject My Messages, really believe that I would divide My Church and ask you to deny My Teachings? Wait until the day, when you are asked to swear allegiance to lies, in the Name of My Holy Church on Earth, before you dismiss My prophet. Only My Love for you is so strong do I not cast you aside and allow you to be devoured by demons.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
