		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, as I reach out to God’s children including all religions, non-believers and Christians, many will, as a result of My Call, convert to Christianity.  This will be achieved through the Grace of God, by the Power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In the meantime, well-meaning Christians and committed followers of Mine will find the trials, which they will have to face, very difficult. I ask them now. Who amongst you is so strong that you will stand by My Side and abide by the Truth, without My Intervention at this time? Many of you, with a good heart, will stay true to Me, but only within your own groups. <strong>Once you all agree with each other, you will find it easier to serve Me. But when you face opposition – and you will, at some stage, from My enemies who will try to entice you into a false doctrine – you will not find it easy. </strong></p>
<p>When you are criticised for following the true Word of God, many of you will be too weak to defend It. Once you face opposition from your fellow Christians, and when you are coerced into accepting newly adapted, but false, scripture, you will be grief-stricken. By then, your faith will be truly tested. You will have two choices. Believe in the Truth, as it was laid down by God, and for which much blood was shed in order to reconcile man with His Maker. Or, accept a watered-down version of My Word, infiltrated with untruths.</p>
<p><b>To choose the first option will bring you much pain, grief and suffering, for you will be held in contempt by others for remaining true to Me</b>. But, by choosing the second option – while you may well be covered with much praise, accepted by your peers and My enemies – you will be plunged into darkness and your soul will be at risk.</p>
<p><b>It is easy to say you are a Christian, once you are not challenged for being one.</b> But if you are scorned, mocked, ridiculed or slandered in My Name, some of you will not be strong enough to withstand these trials. Many of you will desert Me and walk away because of the fear of public opinion. Many of you will betray Me. <b>Many of you will turn your backs because you will be too ashamed to carry My Cross.</b></p>
<p>Never believe that being a follower of Mine is easy, for it is not. But there will come a time when your faith will be put to the ultimate test and it is then that I will know who is of Me and who is not.</p>

<p>Your Jesus</p>
