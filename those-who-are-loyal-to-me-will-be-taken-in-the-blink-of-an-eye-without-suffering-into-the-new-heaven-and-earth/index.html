		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, again, I must tell all of God’s children not to feel worried or frightened of events to come.</p>
<p>All of humanity will witness My Mercy soon and many, while remorseful for their sins, will not fear Me.</p>
<p>Instead, their souls will be flooded with My Divine Love. My Light will radiate through their bodies and they will rejoice.</p>
<p>The time for the New Era of Peace brings tremendous joy and excitement for those who acknowledge My Hand of Mercy.</p>
<p>Every single sinner is invited to live Eternal Life and must not walk away because they are confused. <strong>My Era of Peace will be a new Earth, where twelve nations will rule, under My Guidance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You will live in peace, love and harmony. The natural surroundings you see on the Earth today will pale into insignificance when compared with the world, which lies ahead.</strong></p>
<p>For those worried or frightened for your family or loved ones – bring them with you to My wonderful, New Paradise.</p>
<p>Pray for them and I will give them special Graces so that they will be given the Gift of recognising My Love.</p>
<p>This is My Father’s greatest wish, to see the wonder, joy and love, shine through each of His precious children when He unveils the New Paradise.</p>
<p><strong>You will be reunited with your loved ones who died in a state of Grace and who will be resurrected from the dead.</strong></p>
<p>Why would you not believe in such a Gift? When you trust in My Promise to come again, then you will feel peace.</p>
<p><strong>All I ask is that you prepare through prayer. When you pray for Grace and for others, all will be well.</strong></p>
<p>My Mercy is so great that few will fail to recognise My Divine Promise to gather all of God’s children and take them home and away from the vice-grip of Satan and his demon angels.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth of My Kingdom will be seen even by atheists who will be shocked, yet, their disbelief will in most cases turn into humble love and acceptance.</strong> While many difficult times lie ahead none will be so hard that you cannot overcome them, through your love and devotion to Me, your Jesus. <strong>Please do not allow fear to get in the way of accepting, with joy, the Gift of My New Paradise.</strong></p>
<p>Those who are loyal to Me will be taken, in the blink of an eye, without suffering, into the New Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p>What should concern you, are those hardened sinners who will not ask Me to forgive them, who will refuse My Hand and who will, instead, hold onto their wicked ways.</p>
<p>They need your prayers.</p>
<p>Pray hard for the salvation of their souls.</p>
<p>Your beloved Jesus</p>
