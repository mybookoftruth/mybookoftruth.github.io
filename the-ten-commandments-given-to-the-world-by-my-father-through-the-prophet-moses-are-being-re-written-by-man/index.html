		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, whenever you feel that there is little hope for sinners, please remember that My Great Mercy is ceaseless. There is not one soul in the world I do not wish to embrace and bring them the Gift of Salvation. I love all of you. I forgive all who beseech Me, for the Gift of Redemption, but this does not mean I will not punish those who commit grievous sin.</p>
<p>The Ten Commandments, given to the world by My Father through the prophet Moses, are being re-written by man. They have been taken apart, twisted and given new meaning, so that man can condone sin.</p>
<p>You idolise false gods and justify this. You are living a terrible lie when you insult My Father in this way and yet when the Truth is shown to pagans, they will repent and I will be waiting to embrace them.</p>
<p>You kill one another and say that you are simply showing mercy when you do this. <strong>You legalise murder, execution, euthanasia and abortion and say that these are good things. This is evil at its worst, when you challenge the Author of all life – the Creator of Heaven and Earth – by tampering with the Divine Laws of God.</strong> Yet, when you show true remorse, I will also be waiting to embrace you in My Arms.</p>
<p>You plunder what does not belong to you and you steal from paupers, in order to satisfy your lust for more. You commit terrible sins of the flesh, which are beneath the dignity of man and you behave as wild animals let loose in a pit. Your wretchedness is abhorrent in the Eyes of God, but yet if you call on Me and beg Me for Mercy, I will be there waiting patiently. When you defile God by refusing to accept that He Exists and then try to take His children with you into abyss with the beast, I will still be waiting when you turn and ask Me to make Myself known to you.</p>
<p><strong>Those of you, who do accept the Truth, no longer take the time to honour Me on the Sabbath Day, because you place your own needs before Me.</strong> You hurt Me so, because you already know you are children of God. You have left your Father’s House and <strong>you will only come back when you don’t have a roof over your head. And I will be waiting to welcome you back.</strong></p>
<p>Your love for God has diminished, as has your love and respect for your parents. Your hearts have hardened so much that you do not show them love or care for them in the way you are supposed to.</p>
<p>You curse God and swear, using My Name in the most disrespectful way, daily, but you won’t speak with Me in the way I desire. When you slander others, you slander Me. When you damage another person’s reputation, you destroy My Love. And, yet, I will forgive you, when you show remorse.</p>
<p>You show disrespect for the institution of marriage and think little of abusing this Most Holy Sacrament. You insult God further when you continue to seek His blessings on marriages, when He does not, nor can, recognise them. Yet, you continue to insult Him.</p>
<p>So obsessed are you with the seeking out of worldly goods and so infested are you with unhealthy ambitions, that you destroy those people who get in your way. Despite this, I will show you Mercy, if you come back to Me.</p>
<p>No sin, with the exception of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, is so bad that it cannot be forgiven. I plead with all of you to examine your conscience and become reconciled with Me, once more.</p>
<p><strong>I Am Patient. I Am Love. I Am your Salvation. I Am waiting. Please come to Me soon, for I love you with an unfathomable passion. I will not rest until I have saved all of you.</strong></p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
