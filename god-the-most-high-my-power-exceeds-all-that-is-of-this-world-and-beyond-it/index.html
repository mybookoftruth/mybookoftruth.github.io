		<p>My dearest daughter, humanity has turned against Me and all that I created in My Image and for that My Sorrow is great.</p>
<p>My children will be saved by the Intervention of My dearly beloved Son, Jesus Christ, and this will take place very soon. Before this day I ask all those who love Me to acknowledge the Truth; My Son and His Love; to pray for His Mercy.</p>
<p>You, who love My Son, must remember His Promise to redeem the world and eradicate sin before His Glorious Kingdom descends. Life of the body and the soul will be eternal and those who accept My Son’s Mercy will gain this great Gift. Those who don’t, will not.</p>
<p>Come, My children, and accept My Word, for it is eternal and nothing will destroy it. My adversary seethes with anger at this time, because he knows that the world will be rid of his influence and he will unleash terrible hardships upon those souls he desires to deny the Gift of Eternal Life.</p>
<p><strong>You will be tested beyond endurance in your faith in the Most Holy Blessed Trinity, and many of you will fall.  True faith requires real trust and unless you trust in the promises made by My Son, you will become separated from Him.</strong></p>
<p>Every single child of Mine will be given the proof of My Existence shortly. When this sign is given, do not doubt it, for it is to bring you into My Refuge that I bequeath to you.</p>
<p>Many signs have been given to the world of My Existence and now I bring you much more. Fear not, for I will pursue every soul and there is not one amongst you that I do not love with a tender Heart. I love My enemies, including those who torture Me with their wickedness. But, soon, the Gift I will bring them will awaken a dormant love for their Creator within their hearts. Their love and My Divine Love, combined, will defeat evil. I will wipe away all their fears and tears.</p>
<p><strong>You, My dear children, will be given this Gift when you are least expecting it. For that time is drawing nearer and the face of the world will be changed forever and for the good of all.</strong></p>
<p>My Power exceeds all that is of this world and beyond it. My Kingdom is everlasting.</p>

<p>Your beloved Father</p>
<p>God the Most High</p>
