		<p>My dearly beloved daughter when man questions the Teachings contained in the Holy Bible this is normal human nature.</p>
<p>When man twists the teachings in the Holy Bible to suit his own agenda this offends Me.</p>
<p><strong>But when My sacred servants denounce parts of the Holy Bible and throw them to one side, as if they are of no consequence, they deny Me, the Son of Man.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Everything contained within the Holy Bible comes from My Eternal Father who has sanctioned every single word through His anointed ones</strong>.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p>Believe that the Holy Word of God is contained in My Father’s Book, not one word a lie.</p>
<p>Why then do those who profess to be scholars and experts in the Truth contained with the Holy Bible question My Holy Word as I present it to you in these Messages?</p>
<p>My Truth is being given to you now, once again, to refresh your memories, to remind you of the Teachings contained therein.</p>
<p>To My children on earth, know that prophecies contained in the <strong>Book of Daniel</strong> and the <strong>Book of Revelation still have to take place.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br>
Know that the 1,000 years referred to in the Book of Revelation means just that.</strong><br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p>If it was meant to be something different then it would have been given a different time.</p>
<p><strong>My Church, the Catholic Church, has not declared their beliefs because they have not done this yet. </strong></p>
<p>My Remnant Church, the remaining tendrils of My Catholic Church on earth will understand the true meaning of My Era of Peace on earth.</p>
<p><strong>You are in the end times but the earth will be renewed.</strong></p>
<p>I call out to all of you, My sacred servants. My voice is hoarse as I beg you to respond to My Holy Call from Heaven.</p>
<p>I, your beloved Saviour, have sent many seers and visionaries to you up to now. These helped open your minds to those events still to come.</p>
<p>I have waited until now to proclaim to the world the final revelations. I now send My last messenger, Maria Divine Mercy, the seventh messenger to prepare the final chapter as it is unveiled to you.</p>
<p><strong>My voice is like thunder. It will continue to be heard all over the earth. It will not stop until the day I come to judge.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>You may not listen to Me now. Many of you will dismiss My Word with an arrogance which wounds Me deeply.</p>
<p>Others will, through fear, ignore Me for it is easier that way. But soon the changes I speak about will come to pass. Then the Truth will begin to dawn on you.</p>
<p>I call you now and tell you this. I await your response whether or not it is now or in the future.</p>
<p>I am waiting. I will continue, patiently, until the day you come running to Me seeking My Protection.</p>
<p>I never give up on My chosen servants those whom I called out to in the first instance.</p>
<p>Do you remember the first time I called you?  You felt My voice speaking to your soul urging you to join in union with Me. Can you hear Me now?</p>
<p>Ask Me to reveal to you now, that it is I, your Jesus begging you to come, rise and follow Me on this last arduous journey to Eternal Life. Do not fear My Call. Trust Me and say this prayer asking Me to let you hear My call.</p>
<p><strong>Crusade Prayer (57) Prayer for the Clergy – Jesus let me hear your call</strong></p>
<p>O my dear Jesus<br>
Open my ears to the sound of Your Voice<br>
Open my heart to Your loving call<br>
Fill my soul with the Holy Spirit<br>
So I can recognise You at this time.</p>
<p>I offer You my humble allegiance to all<br>
That You ask of Me<br>
Help me to discern the Truth, rise, respond and<br>
follow your voice so I can help You to save the<br>
Souls of all of humanity</p>
<p>Your will is my command<br>
Give me the courage to let You guide me<br>
So I can take up the armour needed to lead Your<br>
Church towards Your New Kingdom.<br>
Amen.</p>
<p>Remember, I Jesus Christ, will never allow My Sacred Servants to wander off the Path of Truth. I will stand at every corner, every avenue and point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>You may find this frustrating at times. You may be confused. You may not want to hear the Truth. You may be fearful. But know this.</p>
<p>I will always love you. I will always be at your side.</p>
<p>I will never desert you.</p>
