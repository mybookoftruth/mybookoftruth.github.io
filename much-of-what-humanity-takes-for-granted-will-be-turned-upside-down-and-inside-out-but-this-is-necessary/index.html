		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, <strong>because of the tribulations, which the human race has to endure during the Purification, it would be a mistake to confuse the pain it will cause with that of hopelessness. </strong></p>
<p>Much of what humanity takes for granted will be turned upside down and inside out, but this is necessary. When the Purification is exhausted, a new dawn will appear – suddenly and without warning – and the new world will be presented to God’s children.</p>
<p><strong>I ask that, while much pain will be endured by those who love Me, as well as by those who don’t, not one man amongst you should ever believe that there is no hope</strong>. Instead, rejoice because only love, joy, peace and happiness lies ahead in My New Paradise. When the world is cleansed of sin and as many souls as possible are purified, then I will come as a Bridegroom ready to greet you. The Great and Glorious Day is to be anticipated with joy, excitement and longing, for My Heart will burst forth and unite with the whole world.</p>
<p><strong>The New Beginning is within your grasp.</strong> Endure whatever pain and suffering you bear witness to now, for it will mean nothing when you come into My Light, when I will overwhelm you with the love and happiness, which you have awaited all your lives, but which you could not have truly grasped up to then.</p>
<p>Help Me to bring the souls who are lost to Me back into My Arms. Pray for each other. Be joyful. Be hopeful. Be at peace. Whatever lies ahead, know that My Love is more powerful than hatred. My Power is Almighty. My Mercy is endless. My Patience is great.</p>
<p>Go in peace and serve Me, until the last day, for the following Day will be the beginning of the world which will have no end and where death will be no more.</p>
<p>I love and cherish all of you.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
