		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, the time has come for My Eternal Father to wipe clean from the face of the earth, the blemish, which casts darkness over the souls of man. He will punish the wicked and take into His Holy Arms those who uphold the True Word of God. His angels will surge forth, in a great tempest, and with mighty scythes will cut out from the roots the disease, which ravages the souls of men, so that the world can become clean again.</p>
<p><strong>Be fearful of the Wrath of God for when He is propelled into such a rage, men will tremble with fear. Those who believe that God does not punish the wicked do not know Him</strong>. Their voices, loud and proud, which fill the earth with falsities, and those who deem themselves worthy of great favour, in My Father’s Eyes, but who curse the meek amongst My people, will be plucked from the soil and face the greatest chastisement poured over humanity since the great flood.</p>
<p><strong>The angels of God will descend, and with a scythe in their right hands, divide the chaff from the whea</strong>t. Those who curse God will be silenced; those who defile the Son of Man will be silenced; those who defile His Body will wander in confusion, lost and bewildered, before they are plunged into the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>The Love of God has not been reciprocated and His Mercy has been already declined.</strong> Ungrateful souls, whose eyes are set firmly on their own pleasures – and their determination to carry out acts in direct confrontation to the Will of the Lord – will feel the pain of God’s punishment. Like a sheet of lightning, out will pour, like a great tempest, a great upheaval of the earth, which will be felt in every part of the world.</p>
<p>Those who know the Truth will have no fear, for they will be willing witnesses to the promises laid down in Holy Scripture, as to the Great Tribulation to come. Those who have cut God out from their lives – like as if they cut off a limb from their own bodies – will not know of the consequences of cursing God, until it is too late.</p>
<p>You, who have betrayed Me, will suffer the most. You, who have hurled stones at others, in the mistaken belief that you represent Me, will have no one to turn to. For everywhere you try to hide, you will be found naked with nothing to hide your shame.   I tell you this, for the patience of My Father is exhausted and onto the battlefield will emerge two armies – those who are for Me and those who are against Me.</p>
<p>Pray for God’s Mercy.  And to those who scourge My Body know this. You may believe that I can be wiped away from My House but, that would be a grave error on your part.</p>
<p>Away from Me, for you do not belong to Me. Your wickedness will be your downfall and through your allegiance to the evil one, you have cut yourselves away from My Glorious Kingdom.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
