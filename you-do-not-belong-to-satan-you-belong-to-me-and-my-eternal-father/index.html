		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, there are times when you think you will not be able to endure the trials you receive because of My Messages, but you must not fear. Fear is not something that you need to feel. If you can first, let Me take away your fears by trusting in Me completely, you will be free.</p>
<p>O how My children have forgotten the power of the Divine Realm, My daughter. If they could only, for one moment, put down their shield, they would be able to see clearly, parts of My Divine plan for mankind unfold. This shield, the shield of human intelligence driven by human logic, which in turn is ignited by the advances that man has made through science, is nothing but hay. It seems solid, but it is empty of substance. Yet man believes that it provides protection against the Truth, the Truth of God’s Divine Presence.</p>
<p>Your shield, My children, which blocks Me and My Teachings from your life will be your downfall. It will, in time, offer you no protection and will burn so fast, so instantly, just like straw, that you will become naked. Your nakedness will eventually reveal to you the deceit of Satan and all his empty promises of worldly security, which does not really exist. Man’s stubbornness to accept the Existence of My Eternal Father will be the cause of his banishment into the darkness.</p>
<p>When you see My Light, the Flames of My Love, materialise in the skies, shortly, let you be in no doubt. This will not be an illusion. It will be a reality and you must humble yourselves to open your eyes to the Truth. Do not turn your eyes away or cower in fear. My Presence must be greeted by you as your last chance for salvation. It is I Who comes to envelop you in My Arms. It is I, your Saviour, who once again comes to bring you back from the brink of darkness and despair. I have told you I will never forsake you. I will never leave you at the mercy of Satan, for you do not belong to him. You belong to Me and My Eternal Father, your Creator.<br>
<b> </b><br>
When you see My Flames of Glory in the skies, be joyful. Any doubts you ever had about the Existence of God the Father will disappear. To benefit from the graces that The Warning will bring to your soul, so that you can be saved, you must appear little in My Eyes and ask Me to forgive you for your sins. My Love will then flood your soul and you will come back to Me and your rightful home. Resist My Mercy out of arrogance or intellectual reasoning and you will be lost.</p>
<p>Await now My Mercy with joy and enthusiasm, for you will become whole again. You will be reborn.</p>
<p>Your beloved Saviour<br>
Jesus
