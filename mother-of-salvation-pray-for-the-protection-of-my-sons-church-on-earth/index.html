		<p>My dear children, it is important that all of you recite the Crusade Prayers and my Most Holy Rosary as part of your daily prayers. You may choose whichever prayers that you select, not necessarily every Prayer, but those which are according to your desire. My Most Holy Rosary must be recited daily against the influence of the evil one.</p>
<p>Prayer brings you closer to God and protects the souls of all those who request the help of my Son against the power of the deceiver. Prayer is the greatest weapon against evil and you must never underestimate the power that it yields.</p>
<p>Pray for the protection of my Son’s Church on earth and ask my Son to grant Mercy to everyone who tries to crucify it. This Church – the Body and the Temple of my Son – is the path through which all glory will be given to God. The Teachings, the Word and the Holy Eucharist, that is the Body and the Blood of my Son, Jesus Christ, were Gifts given to humanity for the salvation of souls. You must uphold the Truth and prepare to accept my Son’s Mercy.</p>
<p>I urge that you pray for souls who refute the Truth and beg my Son to pour His Mercy over their souls. My Son is Life. All Life comes from Him. Reject my Son and you will not sustain life in His Kingdom to come.</p>
<p><strong>My Son has asked me to plead for your prayers for the souls of those who will reject Him. He will hear the prayers you offer up for all of your loved ones and for those who will be unable to accept the Light when it shines like a beacon and covers humanity.</strong></p>
<p>The souls who are alight with the love and humility necessary to receive my Son will rejoice. Those with darkness in their souls will shun the Light, as they will find it painful to see the Truth. Pray with all your hearts for the souls who are in most need of my Son’s Mercy now and every day from now on.</p>
<p>Without your prayers many will be lost and they will pine for eternity, for the company of my Son, but He will be nowhere for them to find.</p>
<p>I leave you with my love, my protection and my peace. Please respond to my call for the salvation of souls.</p>

<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
