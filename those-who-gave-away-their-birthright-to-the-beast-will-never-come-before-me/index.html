		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, it is through the weak, the vulnerable, the lonely and the humble that I manifest My Divinity. My Power sweeps through such souls into My Holy Will and, it is through them, I can achieve My Plan for the salvation of humanity.</p>
<p>When those who have been called by Me, to proclaim My Holy Word, are diverted from Holy works due to the sin of pride, they try to define My Word with an exaggerated respect for their own human intellect.  They forget that, to follow Me, has already been laid down and that it is My Holy Word that must be heard, and not the sound of their own voices. It is through the sin of lust that they will discard My Word, in their ambitious quest to outshine Me and seek glorification.  It is through the sin of sloth, because of laziness, that they will be guilty of the ultimate betrayal, when they fail to remain loyal to Me because of a lack of faith and courage.</p>
<p>And so it will be in the final lead up to My Second Coming that those who believe they are more worthy, more qualified but full of pride, will face a bitter rebuke and down they will fall. The weak, the humble and the lowly who are deemed by followers in My Church to be of little consequence, but who will cling to the Truth, who will be enveloped by Me on the Great Day. I will call them and beckon them to Me as I gather them into My Kingdom. They will cry tears of joy.</p>
<p>Then I will gather those who do not know Me, but who will be awakened by My Light – good souls, with hearts of gold – and I will say ‘come up here into My Refuge.’  And then, the sinners who committed terrible atrocities, but who asked Me for My Mercy, will be called and I will say ‘come, I forgive you for you sought reconciliation.’</p>
<p>And then, those traitors of Mine, who once knew Me, but who turned their backs on Me, will come but they will not be able to look Me in the Eye. Nor will they seek My Mercy and I will say to them ‘away from Me, you are not fit to enter My Kingdom.’</p>
<p>Finally those who gave away their birthright to the beast, will never come before Me for they will be cast into the furnace along with those who lost Me the souls of those in My Church on earth, who followed them blindly into the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>Then it will be all over and, in a split second, a new beginning – a new world on earth as it was meant to be. A world without end.</p>

<p>Your Jesus</p>
