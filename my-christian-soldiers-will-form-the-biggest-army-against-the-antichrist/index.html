		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, <strong>My beloved followers, all over the world, will soon feel My Presence, for I will make Myself known within their hearts in a way they have not experienced before.</strong> This is how I will prepare Christians to fight, on My behalf, to save the souls of everyone.</p>
<p>My Christian soldiers will form the biggest Army against the antichrist. I refer to all those who know Me and who remain loyal to My Holy Doctrine, contained within the most Holy Bible. I refer also to those who practice their faith; to those who believe in Me, but who do not visit Me and to all those who remain loyal to the Truth. <strong>You will gather in every corner of the world and, although you will join in My Remnant Army speaking in many tongues, you will unite as one in Me.</strong></p>
<p>Those who follow these Messages will form the kernel and from this will grow the shoots and then the branches of My Remnant Army all over the world. <strong>There will be not one country left untouched by My Holy Spirit through the Book of Truth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Book of Truth will unite you when your faith will be tested.</strong> When allegiance to Me is tampered with and when I Am thrown out of your churches, trampled upon and then buried out of sight – you will rise and keep My Word alive. <strong>The Flame of the Holy Spirit will guide you every step of the way.</strong> You will feel a strength and courage, which will surprise even the most meek amongst you. The weak will become strong. The fearful will become brave and the downtrodden will march forward as warriors of the Truth. And all the while, as My Remnant Army will grow and swell in their millions, many obstacles will be placed before them.</p>
<p>Insults, accusations of heresy, lies, anger and hatred will be their lot. Confusion will be seen everywhere amongst the detractors, whose argument will be riddled with inaccuracies, contradictions and incomprehensible arguments. Satan’s influence will always create confusion, disorder, illogical and cunning arguments, and will always be laced with hatred against God’s children. Those who are blessed with the Light of God and the Light of the Truth will attract terrible and hateful attacks. <strong>For where I Am Present, you can be sure that the persecution of those who proclaim My Holy Word will be great. The worse the persecution against any Mission of God, you can be sure that Satan is very angry.</strong></p>
<p>When you suffer, as you will, by the hatred shown to you because you are taking up My Cross to follow Me, the more worried will be the beast and the harder he will work, through the souls of those stained with the sin of pride, to destroy you. You must ignore these attacks. Be at peace, for as they increase with an intense hatred against you, you will know for sure that you are in true union with Me, your Jesus.</p>
<p>Go in love and peace and know that I live in your hearts.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
