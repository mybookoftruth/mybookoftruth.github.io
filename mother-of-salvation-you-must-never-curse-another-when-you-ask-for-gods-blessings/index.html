		<p>My dear child, <strong>when my Son grants special favours, upon God’s children, this means then that there is a responsibility expected on the part of the recipient.</strong> For every Blessing, dear children, you receive from my Son, you must always give thanks to God. <strong>When my Son presents heavenly Graces upon a soul, much is expected of that person. Each soul must then live their lives according to what they have been taught by my Son. </strong></p>
<p><strong>My Son makes His Presence felt when He is called upon.</strong> The more open the soul is to His Love, the more he or she will become closer to His Sacred Heart. However, when a soul exalts himself before my Son, when requesting His help, nothing will yield from Him. God loves the humble souls. He lavishes great Graces upon them. The more Graces they receive, the more of Him will be Present within them. Then, as His Presence is made known, that same soul will be the subject of hatred. <strong>The devil is drawn to souls who are in the Light of God</strong>. He will then use every means to humiliate the chosen soul and usually does this by deceiving the weak soul he uses, to inflict pain and suffering on the humble soul.</p>
<p>Sadly, many people who love me, the Mother of God, come to me begging me to assist them in destroying other souls. These souls, they tell me, are deserving of God’s punishment. When they ask for my Son to pass judgment on such souls, because of the hatred, which lies in their hearts, their prayers will never be heard. <strong>How can you love me, adore my Son and pledge your allegiance to the Truth when you hate others?</strong> Oh how cunning is the evil one when he devours holy souls, who have allowed pride to distract them. <strong>Once pride grips a soul, it immediately loses its light.</strong> T<strong>he darker it becomes the further away it removes itself from the Light of God. </strong></p>
<p><strong>When you ask me to intervene, on your behalf, with my Son, you must always come to me with the fullness of love in your heart.</strong> You must never curse another when you ask for God’s Blessings, for this is abhorrent to Him. Hatred plays no role in Heaven.</p>
<p>Come to me, dear children, only with love in your hearts for your enemies, and all your prayers will be answered according to God’s Holy Will.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
