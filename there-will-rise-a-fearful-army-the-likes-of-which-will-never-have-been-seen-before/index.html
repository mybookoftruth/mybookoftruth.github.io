		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, the world is on the brink of many wars and these will have many repercussions on the speed by which the Church will erupt. It will be during any final peace negotiations, which will take place after much carnage and destruction, that many people will feel helpless, alone, fearful and without any real leadership. It will be because of the weak links in the political world that the world will be at its most vulnerable. Because of this, <strong>there will rise a fearful army, the likes of which will never have been seen before.</strong> <strong>As the world will fragment, so also will many churches. Then when all seems hopeless, a unified group, consisting of political leaders and Christian Church leaders, will be created under a one-world organization – out of which will sprout a new abomination – a new one-world religion. </strong></p>
<p><strong>All of these events will take place in stages.</strong> Your duty, My beloved followers, is to Me, as I guide you, for there is only one road to peace and safety and that is through Me, Jesus Christ. I will guide you through the thorns, the pain and the horror of the abomination of desolation. You will be safe when you cling to Me.</p>
<p>Be strong, My beloved daughter, during these difficult trials, for it will be through your strength and courage that I will be able to show the Way of the Truth, when the world is turned inside out, because of the wickedness brought about by the love of power and corruption, which will bring about these wars and then the Great War.</p>
<p><strong>Move quickly and ensure that you dedicate your lives to prayers and for the protection of My Church on Earth. My Gifts will protect each of you and I will always respond to those who seek Me out, in this time of great turmoil ahead.</strong> <strong>When these events unfold, My Army on Earth will swell.</strong> Those who oppose this Mission will follow Me, for by then they will no longer be able to deny the Truth – when they find that they, too, will suffer the persecution to be faced by Christians everywhere, when they have to endure the reign of the Dragon. Their only hope will be to follow Me, their Jesus, at that stage, for only through Me will they be able to come to My Father’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
