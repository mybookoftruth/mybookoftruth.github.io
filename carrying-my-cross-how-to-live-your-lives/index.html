		<p>Yes, My beloved daughter, it is I. It has been a long learning curve for you and you will continue to be fed with the knowledge of the Truth through the Gift of the Holy Spirit, which fills your soul.</p>
<p>My daughter, please ensure that these Messages, which are a mixture of forewarnings, prophecies and a summary of My Teachings, are spread to every corner of the world. It is vital that My children understand the ways in which they can prepare their souls in order to redeem themselves in the Eyes of My Father.</p>
<p><b>Spiritual Renewal taking place in the world now</b></p>
<p>There is an emerging devotion and honour of Me, My Eternal Father, the Holy Spirit and My beloved Mother, taking place in the world right now. Although it is not clearly visible yet, this powerful spiritual renewal will help protect My children, even those who turn their backs on Me, everywhere. The Gospel will now be revisited, as people will begin to experience the hunger pangs for the Truth. As the Purification steadily increases and becomes more widespread around the world, so too will these souls, empty of love for Me, open their hearts again.</p>
<p>As the love unfolds through the light of My followers, the effects of the evil one and the behaviour of those he infests will weaken. The evil one will retaliate.</p>
<p><b>Satanâ€™s days are numbered</b></p>
<p>As his days on this Earth lessen by the hour, he will attempt to inflict as much damage as he can. His followers will quicken their activities and rise immediately to spread wickedness everywhere. Their actions, which will be terrible to bear witness to, as they manifest themselves before your astonished eyes, will be short-lived.</p>
<p>Faith, My children, strengthened through regular daily prayer, will stamp out these atrocities. Go back, My children, and re-discover My Teachings. Bring Me back into your lives. Take Me into your hearts once more, so that I can hold you in My Arms. Let Me guide you towards spiritual perfection, so that you are prepared for eternal life, when Earth and Heaven emerge as one.</p>
<p>Imitate Me, My children, in your daily lives. Take up My Cross, even when the burden of doing so may seem too much. Never fear to accept My Cross, as I will only allow you to carry what you are capable of.</p>
<p><b>Meaning of suffering in this life</b></p>
<p>When you suffer in this life, you are carrying My Cross. You have two choices. If you reject My Cross, moan and are bitter because of it, then the suffering increases unabated. On the other hand if you accept the Cross and offer up your suffering to save souls, then this is a wonderful gift to Me. If you accept this suffering, the trials and tribulations, with joy, then your load will become lighter. I will help you carry it. The pain will then ease and peace, love, joy and pure happiness will reign in you.</p>
<p><b>Lead simple lives</b></p>
<p>Live simple lives, children, and do everything in moderation. When you eat, drink, sleep, rest and relax, ensure that it is done in moderation. Once your physical needs are met, you should not continue to seek more, as it saps your spirit. Penance, My children, is vital to your becoming closer to Me. By this, I mean personal sacrifice. Fasting is just one example of penance. I preached the importance of penance during My time on Earth. So too did My precious prophet, Saint John the Baptist.</p>
<p>I, by fasting for 40 days, did so to show you an example. It is only by fasting, children, that you will help drive out the evil one.</p>
<p>My dear children, you have so much ahead of you. You do not understand yet what will be required of you in the years ahead. It is important, in the meantime, to draw closer to Me, so that you are prepared for the trials ahead that face Christians throughout the world.</p>
<p>Go in Peace.</p>
<p>Your loving Saviour<br>
Jesus
