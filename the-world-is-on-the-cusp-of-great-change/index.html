		<p>My dearly beloved daughter when God’s children witness strife in the world and terrible atrocities committed in the name of justice, then know this. For evil begets evil. Do onto others and the same will be done onto you. <b>My Justice is inherent and while My Mercy is abundant, My Punishment, when it befalls upon ungrateful and wicked men, is to be feared</b>.</p>
<p>I do not inflict harm upon any man, for this is not what comes from Me. But when evil is inflicted upon God’s children, and when wickedness spreads, I will pour out My Justice and let no man be in any doubt that these times are upon you. Wickedness is derived from sin. Souls who succumb to sin must always try to redeem themselves quickly in My Eyes. Otherwise, sin festers and should you doubt the stranglehold that Satan has over souls, who are filled with hatred and violence, then you must know it is extremely difficult to free such souls from his control.</p>
<p>Once Satan infests a soul, he will constantly torment that person until his mind, his deeds and his actions are in union with the evil one. The infested soul, eventually, becomes possessed and only I, Jesus Christ, can free that soul through exorcism. A soul can become possessed very quickly but it can take years to free it from the grip of the serpent. So, when My Punishment is felt it will be to eradicate evil and punish the perpetrators, who steal the lives of others. I will punish those who take away life of the body and life of the soul.  No evil-doer will be invisible as My Eyes are all seeing.</p>
<p>So much you know of My Love. You are in no doubt as to how great My Mercy is.  But mortal man is unaware of the Wrath of God because this is not something you have been told about. God’s Anger is real. Do you believe that He would allow Satan to destroy His children and then sit back and watch? Did you believe that He would not punish the souls who yield to Satan’s every whim and desire? <strong>While good souls may perish, they will have life. While wicked souls may live, they will have no life.</strong></p>
<p>The world is on the cusp of great change, and everything that God foretold will take place. All that He said would happen will happen. And while I gave you the prophets to warn you, you still did not listen. <strong>You dismissed the many private revelations given to the world so that humanity would be prepared. Still you did not listen.</strong></p>
<p>You must pray that the scale of destruction in the world be diluted, for were you to witness what lies in the future you would fall at My Feet begging for Mercy.  Those who failed to keep the Word of God alive in My Churches on earth will be responsible for the loss of many millions of souls who would, otherwise, have been saved.</p>
<p><b>Shame on you who call Me your own when you proclaim part of the Truth on the one hand, and curse Me on the other</b>. The pain and sorrow endured by Me because of sin, and the separation of man from his Creator, is coming to an end for My Time is now. In the final battle for souls know that as evil escalates, <b>God’s punishment will be ten times that which is inflicted by wicked man upon his brothers and sisters.</b></p>
<p>Fear not My Love but My Justice.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
