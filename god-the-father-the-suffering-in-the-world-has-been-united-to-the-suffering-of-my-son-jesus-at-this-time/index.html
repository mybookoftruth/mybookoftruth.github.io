		<p>My dearest daughter tell all My children of the love and protection I offer those who call on Me.</p>
<p>My Holy Word on earth is, at last, being heard and many souls are <strong>ready to make the greatest leap of faith to embrace the Divine Mercy of My Son, Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
<p>Little do they know that to enter the New Paradise, the New Era of Peace, is but a simple thing.</p>
<p><strong>Look up and accept that you are a child of Mine first</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledge that I created each of you, not one of you an accident, and that you are My children. My Family. My Loved Ones.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>The tenderness in My Heart is full of love for each of you.</p>
<p><strong>Many think that because I Am, The Alpha and The Omega, the beginning and the end that My Power makes Me proud.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This, of course, can never be.</strong></p>
<p>How can the true love of a parent for a child be clouded by pride?</p>
<p>I suffer for each of you. I weep for those lost to Me. <strong>I will use every power to bring My lost children back into My Family, My Kingdom.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a parent who is rejected by their child. The hurt I feel is not for Me, their Father, but for them and the torment they will suffer if I cannot save them.</p>
<p>The suffering in the world has been united to the suffering of My Son, Jesus, at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I do this? Why do I allow suffering? It is because of sin. </strong></p>
<p>Sinners who won’t come to Me willingly can only be saved through the suffering of others.</p>
<p>Those who suffer in this life will be rewarded with My Gifts in the next life.</p>
<p>Help offered freely by those children who love Me is a powerful weapon against the power accorded to Satan.<br>
<strong><br>
Those who fight alongside My Son to save the souls of others can save the whole of humanity.<br>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Satan has power but only that given to him – a power which cannot be taken back until the Day of Judgement.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Many of you, dear children, do not understand the Divine laws that permit these things. But trust in Me as I reveal this.</p>
<p>Satan will steal the souls of My children who do not believe in Me or the goodness which I provide My children.</p>
<p><strong>He becomes powerless when sinners make sacrifices, through suffering, to save their brothers and sisters from going to hell.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>He is rendered impotent when My children pray for those sinners to be saved.</p>
<p>Prayer is the armour of My children who want to help Me to save the whole of humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Gather together, My children, with My Son and help Me unite My family at last.<br>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Help Me to bring you all into the new wonderful Era of Peace.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Only then can My Will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.</strong></p>
<p>Go children. Unite in prayer.</p>
<p><strong>Work with Me, your Father, to help save My family.</strong></p>
<p>Your Beloved Father</p>
<p>God the Most High</p>
