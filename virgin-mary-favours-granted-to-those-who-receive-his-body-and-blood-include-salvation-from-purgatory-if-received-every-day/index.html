		<p style="text-align:justify;">(Received during an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which lasted 20 minutes, during which an image of the Holy Eucharist appeared on her forehead)</p>
<p>My child, the Host, which you see on my forehead, is a symbol, to prove to all of God’s children, the Real Presence of my Son in the Holy Eucharist.</p>
<p>My Son is present in the world and stands beside each of God’s children every day in the hope that they will feel His Presence.</p>
<p>Children, it is only through receiving the Real Body of My Son, Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of mankind, that you will be blessed with special graces.</p>
<p>When my Son died for your sins, so that every child of God would be able to defy death, He left behind an important legacy.</p>
<p>The Presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist is Real and when consumed, brings you special protection. It brings you closer in union with Him.</p>
<p>He is the Bread of Life. This Gift to you, children, must never be questioned or rejected.</p>
<p>The favours granted to those who receive His Body and Blood include salvation from Purgatory, if received every day.</p>
<p><strong>My Son will take you, at the time of death, into His Arms away from the fires of Purgatory.</strong></p>
<p>The Holy Mass, which offers the Real Body of my Son, in honour of my Father, brings with it, also, great benefits.</p>
<p><strong>The more daily Masses you attend and the more you receive the Body and Blood of my Son, in the Holy Eucharist, you will be granted immunity from the purification in the fires of Purgatory.</strong></p>
<p>Those of you who dismiss the Existence of my Son, in the Holy Eucharist, deny yourselves a great Gift. You will not be condemned for refusing His Body in the Holy Mass, but you will not receive the graces, which He wishes to bestow on all of God’s children.</p>
<p>The Holy Communion you receive must be Consecrated properly. When you receive His Body, He will fill you with a deep and humble love, which will strengthen your faith and bring you Eternal Life.</p>
<p>The Holy Eucharist is the Gift, which will grant you Eternal Life. Never forget this.</p>
<p>My Son suffered greatly to give the world this great Gift, the passport to Heaven. Do not reject it. Do not challenge His generousity. Do not underestimate the Power of the Holy Host.</p>
<p>Please recite this Crusade Prayer (81) for the Gift of the Holy Communion</p>
<p><strong>O Heavenly Host, fill my body with the nourishment it needs.<br>
Fill my soul with the Divine Presence of Jesus Christ.<br>
Give me the graces to fulfil the Holy Will of God.<br>
Fill me with the peace and calm, which comes from Your Holy Presence.<br>
Never let me doubt Your Presence.<br>
Help me to accept You in Body and Soul, and that, by the Holy Eucharist, the Graces bestowed upon me, will help me to proclaim the Glory of Our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
Purify my heart.<br>
Open my soul and sanctify me when I receive the great Gift of the Holy Eucharist.<br>
Grant me the graces and the favours it bestows upon all God’s children, and grant me immunity from the fires of Purgatory. Amen.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>My children, you must pray that all Christians will accept and understand the Power of the Holy Eucharist. It is the armour required to salvage the souls of all my children.</p>
<p>Accept it with good grace and generousity of heart.</p>
<p>Your Blessed Mother<br>
Mother of Salvation</p>
