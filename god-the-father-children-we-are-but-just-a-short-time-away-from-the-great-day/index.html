		<p>My dearest daughter, <strong>while the world strives to make sense out of the despair they witness, know that all of these turmoils must take place, before I bring all those who love Me into My Place of Refuge. </strong></p>
<p>You will soon know Who I Am, children. Those of you who are unsure of Me will see the Truth at last and this will bring you great peace. The evil in the world increases now and the deceit descends. You must be strong, I plead with you, as I await now the day when the renewal will begin and all of My children will find solace on the Day, when My beloved Son declares Himself.</p>
<p><strong>What you are witnessing is a battle between My Heavenly Hierarchy and Satan and all his demons.</strong> It is frightening and very upsetting for many of you, but know that I will intervene to ease your pain. Know that you are Mine and that I will bring peace to the world, when I have rid it of infestation.</p>
<p>Children, we are but just a short time away from the Great Day and while much still has to take place, where the Sacred Name of My Son will be torn apart, it will be swift. <strong>You must look now to the future, as it is a glittering jewel of such magnitude that on the Day when you enter the New Era of Peace, you will have forgotten the persecution inflicted upon the world by the evil one.</strong> You must do as My Son instructs you. You must remain calm as the Seals are revealed to you, which are all for your own good and those whose souls I ask you to plead for My Mercy.</p>
<p>If you stay true to My Commandments and live your lives in union with My Son, you will be half way there. If you remain firm to the Sacraments and refuse to participate in pagan rituals, which honour the beast, then you will find much favour with Me.</p>
<p>Go and remember that I Am the Almighty One and that all Power is Mine. Soon, I will destroy the wicked and unveil My New Paradise to you. Be patient. Trust in Me. <strong>Follow My Son and accept the Gifts, which He and His beloved Mother, the Immaculate Virgin Mary, bring you, in the form of the Crusade Prayers and the Medal of Salvation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finally accept My Seal as one of the greatest Gifts I have given humanity since I gave them Life. I give Life again with My Special Graces when you hold close to you, the Seal of the Living God. All those with the Seal are granted a place in the New Paradise.</strong></p>
<p>I love you, children, but I Am your Father and I must allow these trials, as they will help Me to weed out those who will never deviate from the side of the beast. The time I spend trying to win over their hearts creates a terrible and hateful battle, with millions of fallen angels and demons, even though it be just one soul.</p>
<p>Remain comforted in the knowledge that I bless all of you, who are pure and humble of heart. I love all of you, so you must never give up when all seems hopeless, for My Power means that the destruction of evil is under My Control. You must place all your trust in Me, especially at this time, when you feel that My Justice is harsh.</p>
<p>Your beloved Father</p>
<p>God the Most High</p>
