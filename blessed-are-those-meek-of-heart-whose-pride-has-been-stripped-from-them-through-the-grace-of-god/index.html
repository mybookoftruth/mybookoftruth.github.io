		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, who amongst you, who truly love Me, can come before Me and lie prostrate at My Feet in total abandonment?</p>
<p>Who amongst you, who truly honours Me and follows My Teachings, can humble themselves before Me without any regard for themselves? If you can throw yourselves at My Mercy, in humble servitude, I will raise you up and exalt you. But when you exalt yourselves, in My Name, and say you know Me more intimately than others, I will cast you to the ground beneath My Feet.</p>
<p><strong>Why do so many, who have been given the Truth, still misunderstand the Truth of My Teachings?</strong> Man, because of the stain of sin, is not worthy to stand before Me. But those who understand the weakness of the human soul must know, that those who take it upon themselves to declare their superior knowledge of spiritual matters laid down by the Teachings of God, through the prophets, need to be very careful. When such souls declare their so-called knowledge, by boasting of their intellectual assessment of Holy Doctrine, instead of focussing on the importance of humility, they offend Me. When they use their knowledge to twist the Truth to suit their agenda, in order to draw souls into a manmade version of My Teachings, I Am deeply offended and I will punish souls guilty of this crime against God.</p>
<p><strong>Those among you who create cults, spiritual movements, all of your own making, know that when you tamper with the Word of God, you are guilty of grave sin.</strong> Your voices, which proclaim the Word of God and all His Glory, on the one hand, are heard because they contain the Truth. But when you add to the Word of God, with your own interpretations and when you use this to attack others in My Holy Name by accusing them of wrong-doing, you commit sin.</p>
<p>Blessed are those meek of heart, whose pride has been stripped from them through the grace of God, for they will rule as kings in the New Paradise.</p>
<p>Blessed are those whose complete trust in Me means that they preach and spread My Holy Word without any intention of seeking personal attention of self-glory, for they too will find refuge in My Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>Those who claim that they are dedicated followers of Mine, but who believe that they are qualified to judge others, analyse the beliefs of others whose faith in God causes offense and who publicly condemn holy souls who come in My Name, are not part of My Kingdom.</strong> You belong to the evil one, for you do not report to Me, Jesus Christ. I have not called you, nor have I given you permission to promote any form of special group, set up to ridicule another group.</p>
<p><strong>To all who proudly boast of intellectual prowess, associated with My Teachings, in order to belittle another child of God, especially chosen souls, know that your days are numbered.</strong> In the past, My Patience would have prevented Me from interrupting such misguided missions. Now, in these end times, I will not tolerate the way in which you try to block My Second Coming.</p>
<p>So few of you will accept My plan to prepare you for the Second Time of My Coming – this time to bring you into the New Era of Peace. You already know the Truth. You know that I will come again, but you will not, just as it was before, accept that it is I, the King of all that is, Who is calling on you to prepare your souls.</p>
<p>Two thousand years to Me is nothing. It is as if it were yesterday. So today, I Am calling out to all of you. What saddens Me is that those who say they love Me, and publicly acknowledge Me, do not really know Me. They have allowed the trappings of organised religions, international politics, exaggerated grandeur and ceremonies to hide from Me.</p>
<p>I Am simple in mind, body and soul, and therefore embrace first, those who come before Me in this way. When a father welcomes home a child, who has been abroad for some time, he does not notice his clothes, his shoes, his jewellery or his suitcase. He sees only his son, his face and the love that has existed in his heart since the first breath he took when he  came out of his mother’s womb. He is not interested in his wealth, his views, his opinions or his gossip about others – all he knows is the love, which he feels for his child and the love his child feels for him.</p>
<p>Love is simple. It is without complication. It does not come from hatred. You cannot love someone when your soul is full of anger or hate. When you love Me, you must love all those who follow Me, no matter what their weakness is. You must love even those who are guilty of terrible sins, for I can forgive the most wicked of all sins. The thing to remember is that not one man has the right to condemn another in My Name. This can only come from Me.</p>
<p><strong>Know this, that when it comes to warning the world of sinners, who are enemies of God, I have this right. But in every instance, I will ask for prayers for their souls.</strong> There will be only one exception. I can never ask you to pray for the antichrist, for he does not come from God.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
