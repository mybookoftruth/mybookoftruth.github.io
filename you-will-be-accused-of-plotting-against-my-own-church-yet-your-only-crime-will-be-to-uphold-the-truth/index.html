		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, not for one moment will the evil one stop in his persecution of those who love Me. When souls are close to Me and when their love for Me grows, he will always be there trying to draw them away from Me.</p>
<p>When you save souls through your prayers, the evil one will vent all his anger against you and you will feel hurt because you will become a target for criticism, especially by those you love. You must get used to this hurt and sorrow when you follow Me and when you accept My Intervention, through these Messages. <b>They will bring with them a terrible scourging, for these Messages will be responsible for the salvation of over 7 billion people.</b></p>
<p>When the devil knows he is losing souls to Me, he will use whatever means is necessary to create doubts within the minds of those loyal to Me and then he will create a terrible friction amongst My followers. You must recognise the work of the devil for what it is and know that the more you are persecuted, for accepting My Hand of Mercy, that you are following the Truth. Only the Word of God, when present in Its most powerful way – when the Holy Spirit becomes evident amongst groups of God’s children – will the evil one fight the hardest. He, Satan, is furious because of this Mission. And for those of you who doubt My Word, given to you at this time, know this.</p>
<p><b>Only My Word can provoke such outrage, even amongst those who believe in Me and who follow My Teachings. Not one of you is immune to attack</b>. You, My precious followers, will find yourselves at the receiving end of the lashing out of wicked tongues, against Me. You will be spit at, laughed at and ridiculed. <b>You will be accused of plotting against My Own Church, yet your only crime will be to uphold the Truth</b>. Those who uphold the Word of God and who refused to deviate from the Truth have always suffered by the hands of those who placed themselves as the most chosen of God’s representatives, before those poor souls who truly loved Me.</p>
<p>There is a difference between those who say they are better informed and therefore more worthy to pass judgement on others in My Name, than those who simply love Me. You can only stand up and declare your love for Me if you follow My Example. <b>I would never say that one man is better than another – for you are all sinners</b>. Yet I would never accept those who may know everything there is to know about Me and who declare their superiority over another. Those who say they know Me and insult another in My Name do not truly know Me at all.</p>
<p>The devil fills souls with ego, pride and anger. They are the three traits by which you will know that he is present in one soul, when he tries to silence other souls who proclaim the Truth of God. How such souls will suffer, especially now, as this, the most awaited Mission, is being lived out amongst you. Every one of you who responds to My Call will have to face abuse and public ridicule, which will take your breath away – so vicious will the outpouring of hatred be. I want you to understand that it is not you that the hatred is aimed at, but Me. Satan wishes to silence My Voice, as it reaches out to save you from his wicked plan, which has been carefully orchestrated and which has been planned for such a long time. There can be no victory for the beast, but he knows how I suffer when he snatches souls from Me. Do not allow this interference to blind you to the Truth.</p>
<p><b>The Truth will save your soul and when you spread the Truth, it will bring Me more souls. By these means, I will defeat the beast</b>. You will be protected from all harm, but you will suffer the indignity of being labeled fools. And all because you love Me.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
