		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, just as My Beloved Mother was chosen by God to herald the Coming of the Messiah so, too, is she being called to prepare humanity for My Second Coming.</p>
<p>She has been elevated into the highest Hierarchy in Heaven and has been accorded great powers by My Eternal Father. Nevertheless, she remains as was then, and as is now, and always will be, a devoted and humble servant of God. She serves Him in His Plan to raise man to the perfect state in which he was meant to be.</p>
<p><b>The beauty of man, created in the Living Image of God, is indescribable. No man, woman or child on this earth can match that, which was created when God brought forth Adam and Eve</b>.  Sin was their downfall and Lucifer their enemy.  Then, this perfect state was destroyed. Stained by sin, man will never regain this perfect state again until the serpent, and all those who worship him are banished.  Until that day comes, the beauty of the human body and soul will remain tarnished.</p>
<p>Man is God’s greatest love.  The angels are His servants in that they, too, must show love for God’s Creatures. <strong>God’s Love for His family supersedes all that He created and, until He regains the souls of His children, He will never rest.</strong>  God permits many sufferings, humiliations and tragedies, all of which are caused by the hatred of the one whom He held in the highest regard – the former Archangel Lucifier, who became Satan.  Fallen because of his jealousy, pride and self-love, he caused My Father the greatest pain imaginable. And today, just as it was then, he still does the same.</p>
<p><strong>My Father’s loyal angels, all the saints and My beloved Mother, have formed a bond, which can never be broken. Whatever My Father dictates is carried out by His Elite Hierarchy. He is never questioned</strong>. Whatever My Father desires, is the correct way and the most powerful way. It is the way in which the human race can be saved from the curse of the evil one. That is His prerogative. No one would ever dare to question Him. In His Final Plan, the final stage in which He will bring His Plan of Salvation to an end, He will intervene in many ways.</p>
<p><strong>My Mother’s title, ‘The Mother of Salvation’, the final one given to her by the Eternal Father, God the Most High, is no accident. She was sent to warn the world and prepare it for the final onslaught against the human race by the evil one. She has been accorded this task and I ask that you accept this, and respond to her call for prayer at all times.</strong></p>
<p>The Holy Trinity will bring about many Blessings to those who respond to this, the final mission, from Heaven – the Mission of Salvation. Accept, with thanks that such favour has been shown to humanity with love and graciousness of  heart.</p>
<p>Your Beloved Jesus</p>
