		<p>My dear children, the Crucifixion of my Son was significant, in many ways. It was not only by the hands of the Roman soldiers that He was killed but on the orders of those who claimed to be dedicated followers of the Word of God.</p>
<p><strong>His scourging, persecution and death were carried out under the instructions of those who led the faithful in the Temple of God</strong>. They discarded all that they knew to be the Truth, because they refused to accept that my Son, Jesus Christ, was the Messiah. Every Law, dictated by God, was flouted as they took pleasure in my Son’s execution.</p>
<p><strong>Before the Day of the Lord comes they will re-enact His Crucifixion. </strong>They will scourge Him, through their betrayal of His Holy Word. They will persecute those who remain loyal to Him and, then, they will desecrate His Body.  But they will fail to kill Him, for His Body – His Church – cannot die and it will remain standing, albeit in a fragile state, until the end.</p>
<p><b>At this time, you must remember that all life comes from God. Death has no power over God. Life, once given, can never die. Death will soon have no power over man and through the Resurrection of my Son, man will also have Eternal Life of the body and of the soul</b>. Those who trust in Christ and stay true to Him will have life. Only those who completely reject Him will not.</p>
<p>Rejoice in the knowledge that a glorious life awaits all of you, who adhere to the Holy Word of God, for death will never destroy you.</p>

<p>Your Beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
