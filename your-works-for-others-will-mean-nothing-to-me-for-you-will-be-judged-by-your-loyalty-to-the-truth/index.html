		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, My people were given a great Gift by Me through My Death on the Cross. This Sacrifice, given up to redeem the world from certain death, is part of My Father’s Final Covenant before the Great Day when He salvages the remnant from the earth.</p>
<p>Generation after generation spoke of the Truth, contained in My Father’s Book, and His sacred servants endorsed the Word of God.  How much you have forgotten and how little you know. Many of those appointed to lead you have erred and their proud heads, held high as they dabble with the Word of God, will hang in shame and fear when they are faced with the Warning from Heaven.  To these sacred servants I have this to say.</p>
<p><strong>Your works for others will mean nothing to Me for you will be judged by your loyalty to the Truth. I will punish you and My Justice will be relentless until you tear up your pagan laws and proclaim the Word given to you so long ago. Your contempt for the Laws of God brings Me great shame but your deceit, which will cost Me souls, will lead to your ruination. Those of My people, who live by the Word of God, though they are nothing in your eyes, will sit upon the Seats of Judgment when you are called to answer, before Me, the reasons why you misled My People. You may believe that your power and influence is beyond reproach but know that your glory is fading and soon; the gold and white cloaks that you wear will be turned into rags and your glittering crowns replaced with weeds.</strong></p>
<p>For all the sins in the world, there is nothing worse in My Eyes, than those hypocrites who pose as My servants but who do not serve Me. When the time comes when you will blaspheme against Me, and feed God’s children with lies about the meaning of sin, I will send down upon you a punishment so great that you will find it difficult to catch your breath. Hailstones of such large dimensions will hurl down from the Heavens and for every Church, which has been handed over to My enemies, where they will desecrate My Altars, great floods will destroy them.  For every crime you commit against Me, you commit against a child of God. And so, I will send you warning after warning until you reject the new false doctrine; until you speak the Truth – the Holy Word of God – and uphold the Sacraments like you were taught in the beginning.</p>
<p>Through these messages I will remind you of the Truth and I will continue to warn you until the day that you decide who to choose – Me or those who profess they are of Me but who are slaves to the beast.</p>

<p>Your Jesus</p>
