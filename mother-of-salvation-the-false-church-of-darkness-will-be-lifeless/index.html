		<p>My dear children, the false church – the one that will replace my Son’s Church on earth – has been prepared and all the heresies will be cleverly concealed between the paragraphs of the new missal, which will replace the old.</p>
<p>The false church of darkness will be built to replace the old after the great inferno.  All that was present in my Son’s Church will be replaced with all that will be new. But, one thing will never change. The foundations, upon which my Son’s Church was built, will not move as they are firmly planted in the ground.  No man will, nor can, move them because God will not permit this.</p>
<p>The church of darkness will be lifeless. No fruit will it yield as it will be built on rotten soil. Every kind of heresy will spring from the mouths of those who will preach from its pulpits. It will become a den of iniquity and nothing that will be proclaimed by the voices, which will boast of its greatness, will make any sense.</p>
<p>Those will be the days when many Christians, too frightened, too tired and lacking in any real faith, will worship within its walls. It will not be my Son they will worship, but the antichrist, for it will be he who will sit on the throne, which they will erect within its walls.</p>
<p><b>The antichrist will rule close by to where my Son built His Church and many people will believe it to be of Him but that would be the biggest error. Anyone who objects to this church, or who finds fault with it, will be ridiculed and accused of heresy by those traitors of my Son, who will, themselves, be the greatest heretics ever to infiltrate the Church of God, since the day of its inception.</b></p>
<p>Pray, pray, pray that there will remain a strong army of my Son’s priests who will never give into the pressures, which lie ahead.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
