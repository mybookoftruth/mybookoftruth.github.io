		<p>My dearly beloved daughter it has been a very tough journey for those followers of mine who follow this mission.</p>
<p>They are ridiculed by those whose opinions they value.</p>
<p><strong>They are mocked by those who claim to be spiritually mature and they are spat upon by those who deny Me, Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
<p>They must accept the Crown of Thorns and the humility which is needed to bear the pain of suffering in My Holy Name.</p>
<p>Let no man underestimate the thorny path towards eternal salvation.</p>
<p>If you endure the agony you will be purified quickly and then you will be able to help the others whose purification will not take place until after The Warning.</p>
<p><strong>There will be times, My beloved disciples, when lies will be planted in your minds by others who want you to abandon My mission.</strong></p>
<p> You must simply remain firm, courteous and then stay silent when you face this persecution.</p>
<p>Never argue or try to prove the authenticity of My Holy Word for you will trip up and then you will fall. It will be then that you will be kicked and you will find it difficult to move on to promote My Holy Word. In, other words, you will become stuck. Then confusion will set in and, in some cases, you will turn your back on Me.</p>
<p>Many of My followers, who took up their cross to follow Me in this mission, to save souls, could not continue on their arduous journey.</p>
<p><strong>Some allowed others to plant the seeds of doubt in their minds.</strong></p>
<p> Others believed the lies they were told to deny this, <strong>My last holy mission on earth to prepare humanity for My Second Coming.</strong></p>
<p>Only those with a simple love for Me, with a deep loyalty, and who understand the role of suffering in the salvation of souls, had the stamina to continue.</p>
<p>It is not easy to follow Me, your Jesus. While following My teachings may bring you closer to My Sacred Heart, it is only when you surrender, to the reality that is the Cross, can  you really call yourself a disciple of Mine.</p>
<p><strong>Many poor souls believe that they will receive great power, great glory and recognition in the world when your respond to My Call. This is not the case.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am a suffering victim and therein lies My power over Satan.</strong></p>
<p>I am not the Son of Man people expect Me to be. I am unconventional. I chose unworthy souls to deliver My messages.</p>
<p>I call the poorest, the meekest and the greatest of sinners because I need to show you that you are all equal in My Eyes. But it will only be those who accept that only those humble of mind and soul can be embraced by Me and who will walk quickly towards spiritual perfection.</p>
<p>Suffer in My Name and I will raise you up in glory in the New Paradise.</p>
<p>Accept the Truth of My Divinity, in that I will never exalt Myself through My genuine prophets, nor will they seek glory in My Name.</p>
<p>Now, come to Me with a trust and abandonment so I can make you Mine.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
