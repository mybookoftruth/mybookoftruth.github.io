		<p>My dear children, as God’s cherished little ones, you must never allow disagreements to turn into hatred for one another. The evil one creates terrible suffering amongst you by spreading his evil infestation and especially against God’s chosen visionaries and prophets.</p>
<p><strong>When God is present in a Mission, which is sanctioned by Him on Earth, in order to save souls, Satan will always attack it. You will know God’s true prophets by the persecution and hatred, which is shown to them. You will know them by the public rejection of their missions and the wicked actions inflicted by others against them.</strong></p>
<p>When a mission, which professes to speak the Word of God, is false there will be no hatred shown towards it, because Satan will never publicly attack those he deceives. <strong>When my Son makes Himself known, He will always be violated, as the sin of man separates him from God. When my Son walked the Earth, everywhere He went they screamed at Him. They cursed Him and threw stones at Him and all those who followed Him. And while they declared Him to be a fraud, they fawned over the many false prophets, who tried to compete with Him. The same will be true as He makes His final journey to gather up all those who remain in Him and with Him.</strong> He will unite all those who live by His Teachings and who remain true and humble servants. Then, with the help of His Remnant Church, He will fight to the bitter end to salvage as many souls as possible, including the souls of all His enemies and all those who refuse to accept Him.</p>
<p>If you love my Son, you must never hurt Him by hating one another. My Son has told you that you cannot remain in union with Him when there is hatred in your heart.</p>
<p>Pray, pray, pray that all of you who declare yourselves to be Christians will follow the example set by my Son.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
