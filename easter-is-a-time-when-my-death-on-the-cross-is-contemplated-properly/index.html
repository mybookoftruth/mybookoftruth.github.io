		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, how you console Me, in My time of sorrow. How you give Me the love and comfort I so desire from souls. Oh were all souls to unite and intertwine their hearts with Mine, God’s holy family would be fully complete. Only when all souls are salvaged will My Father’s Divine Will be done.</p>
<p>Easter is a time when My death on the Cross is contemplated properly and My Resurrection from the dead is fully acknowledged, for the freedom it brings humanity.</p>
<p><strong>My Resurrection means that all of you who love Me and proclaim My Holy Word, can also be raised from the dead.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All those who have died in a State of Grace, and favoured by My Father, will also be raised in glory from the dead on the Day I come to Judge.</strong></p>
<p>They will join those, who are alive not just in body, but in the Spirit of the Lord and be awarded Eternal Life.</p>
<p>Many people do not understand My Promise.</p>
<p><strong>All those whose names are contained in the Book of Life will be raised body, mind and soul, free of bodily corruption and in full union with Me.</strong></p>
<p>All those chosen, will live according to the Divine Will of My Father.</p>
<p>You will live in love, peace and harmony during my Glorious Reign on Earth for 1000 years.</p>
<p>You will join in glory, with the first resurrection of the dead. Those souls, including your beloved family and friends, who are deemed fit to enter My New Paradise on Earth.</p>
<p>This is the life you must all seek out. Let there be no doubt.</p>
<p>For those poor souls who cannot accept the Truth of My Existence or My Promise to Judge the living and the dead, they will tear their hair out when faced with the terrible fate, which will lie ahead of them when the Truth is revealed.</p>
<p>For those believers, you must also be careful.</p>
<p>Many of you who do not love Me enough or take Me for granted, making the mistake of believing that My Mercy ignores sins, where no remorse exists.</p>
<p>My Mercy is abundant, I want to lavish My Graces upon every sinner. But there are those, who are smug in the false assumption, that their knowledge of My Teachings is enough to save them.</p>
<p>They are indifferent to My Love. They lack a tender heart, have little humility in their souls and believe that certain sins are not worth repenting.</p>
<p>This thinking is dangerous and serves only to remove such souls from Me further.</p>
<p>There is not one sin so small that can be ignored. <strong>Absolution can only be given when you repent. You can only repent if you are free from pride and humble of heart.</strong></p>
<p>Rejoice, My children, this Easter. Just as My death on the Cross gave you the Gift of salvation, it was My Resurrection from the dead that will also give you the Eternal Life, which has been planned by My Eternal Father for so long.</p>
<p><strong>You have much to look forward to. For the Eternal Life promised to you, means just that – eternal life, in body, mind and soul.</strong></p>
<p>It is important that you strive for this new life and that you prepare your souls.</p>
<p><strong>Every effort will be made by Satan and his demons to convince you that Eternal Life in My New Paradise does not exist. That My Second Coming is a lie.</strong></p>
<p>Priests, members of the clergy and devout Christians, will be the first target.</p>
<p>Pray, pray, pray to My Eternal Father to protect you with My Precious Blood so that not one of you strays from the Truth.</p>
<p>Your beloved Jesus Christ</p>
<p>Redeemer of Mankind</p>
