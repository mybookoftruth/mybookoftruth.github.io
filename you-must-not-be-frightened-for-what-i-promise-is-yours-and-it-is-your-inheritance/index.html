		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, the world must be told that <strong>My Time to return is close.</strong> My Time has already begun, as I strive to turn humanity towards Me, before My Great Day.</p>
<p><strong>I Am preparing all of you at this time</strong>, although many will turn a deaf ear. I do this with love, for every single one of you for whom I love, for every single one of you for whom I gave up My Body. You are going to witness My Intervention, when I will open the eyes of humanity and which will be clearly witnessed.</p>
<p>Miracles will take place when My Mission is accepted. My Presence will be felt and I will make Myself known through Acts of Great Mercy. This plan is to entice you back, to turn those of you who no longer believe that I Exist, towards My Glorious Salvation.</p>
<p><strong>I Am the King, Who will Reign over the New Paradise promised to Me by My Father.</strong> To those who do not know Me, hear Me now. You are Mine. I bring you LIfe, not as you know it on this Earth, but Eternal Life.</p>
<p>You must not be frightened, for what I promise is yours and it is your Inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>This Kingdom is what you were born for, so that God, My beloved Father, could re-create the world, as it was in the beginning. He is the Beginning, for He created it.</strong> He is the End, for when the Great Day comes there will be no more suffering, for the New Beginning – Eternal Life – will be presented to those who accept God’s Love. You must become more trusting, less cynical and accept the Great Gift of Life, which can only come from a perfect God.</p>
<p>Only God could create such a miracle – the Gift of Life.</p>
<p>Only God can give you Eternal Life, where death will be conquered, and with it all evil.</p>
<p>You must look to the future with anticipation. <strong>You must try to listen to these Messages, for they will be the lifeline you will need, as the days ahead will become darker.</strong></p>
<p>It is My Desire that none of you should fret, feel worried, frightened and sad, for My Glorious Day will mean that I will wipe every tear, pain, sadness and suffering from you and cleanse you with My Great Glory.</p>
<p><strong>You will experience pure everlasting happiness, at last.</strong> Everything you ever imagined to be a state of Heaven, will be yours.</p>
<p>If you cannot respond to Me now, because of a lack of trust, I will help you if you call on Me. Ask Me for the Gift of Trust through this Crusade Prayer.</p>
<p><b>Crusade Prayer (109) for the Gift of Trust</b></p>
<p><i>O my dearest Jesus,</i></p>
<p><i>Help me to trust You.</i></p>
<p><i>To trust in Your Promise to come again.</i></p>
<p><i>To accept the Truth of Your Second Coming.</i></p>
<p><i>To trust in the Promise of God the Father when He said He would give You Your Kingdom. </i></p>
<p><i>Help me to trust in Your Teachings, in</i></p>
<p><i>Your Plan to save the world.</i></p>
<p><i>Help me to accept, with Grace, Your Gifts.</i></p>
<p><i>Help me to trust in You, so that I lose my fear and so that I can allow Your Love to flood my heart and soul.</i></p>
<p><i>Amen.</i></p>
<p>Oh, how I yearn to comfort you, ease your fears, worries and concerns. How I desire to make the transition as painless as possible, so that you won’t have to suffer by the hand of the beast, whose work will be seen through the enemies of God.</p>
<p><strong>If you trust in Me completely and surrender yourself to My Mercy, I solemnly promise that My Mercy will shorten the time when human suffering will escalate because of the wickedness of those who want to cause your suffering. </strong></p>
<p>I pledge that My Intervention, through miracles, will awaken those most in need of help – an awareness of the Truth. When the Truth of God, is accepted by those who do not really understand My Promise to come again, but who accept it, within their hearts, then suffering will be reduced and I will show Mercy to billions of souls.</p>
<p>Your trust in Me, however, will help you to see the Truth. When you accept the Truth, you accept the Keys to My New Kingdom.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
