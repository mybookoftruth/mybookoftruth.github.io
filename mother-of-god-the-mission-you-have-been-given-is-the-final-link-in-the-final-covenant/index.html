		<p>My dear child, I have revealed to you, during this very special apparition today, the secret of my Heart and how it is entwined with the Sacred Heart of my beloved Son. <strong>My Heart beats in union with His and as Co-Redemptrix, I will work to bring so many of God’s children into the New Era of Peace.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As the Mother of God, I have been given power over the beast, and all those who invoke my help will be granted great protection from Him.</strong> Because of this special power, given to me by my Son, every attempt will be made to dishonour my Name during the reign of the beast. Public events will be organised to honour my wishes of uniting all God’s children. Sadly, not all of them will respect the Truth.</p>
<p>I have revealed the Truth at La Salette, in France, and at Fatima, in Portugal, yet many do not understand what it is that I explained. Soon, the prophecies foretold will become a reality and then the hatred, which the evil one has for me, will be manifested in special ceremonies, which will be insulting to God.</p>
<p>My Son has created a very special plan, which has been crafted to every single detail, in order to ensure that the world is given the Truth about the enemies of God. He does this because only the Truth can save the human race. Should God’s children follow lies and become involved with deceit, borne of the plan of the antichrist, then, they will turn their backs on my Son and their own salvation.</p>
<p><strong>The Mission you have been given, my child, is the final link in the final Covenant, which my Son must complete in obedience to my Father, God the Most High.</strong> It will be the instrument by which souls will be salvaged from the grasp of Satan and his evil army on Earth. Because of this, the hatred shown to you through the words, deeds and actions of others will be cruel and fierce. The anger shown against you will be like no other and you must understand that this is to be expected. My Son’s Work, in these times, will be bitterly opposed and He and His Church on Earth will have to endure a final Crucifixion before the resurrection, promised to all those who believe in my Son, takes place.</p>
<p>The hatred is real and the evil one will turn the minds of even those chosen souls and visionaries against you, my child. Never feel sad for yourself or those souls, because the suffering of my Son is ten times worse. It is my Son, the Saviour and Redeemer of mankind, Who died for the sins of man, Who is still hated with a passion, which is borne out of anger and orchestrated by Satan. It is my Son Who is the subject of such attacks and when they fling insults at you, my child, they scourge Him all over again.</p>
<p><strong>You must rise, all of you, and do as my Son tells you, as you have been chosen to form His Remnant Army.</strong> When you suffer in His Name, it is for the glory of God and the salvation of humanity. When the New Heaven and the New Earth become one, such suffering will cease and all will sing praise to God.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of God</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
