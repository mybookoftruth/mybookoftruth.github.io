		<p>My dearest beloved daughter, the time for the changes in how governments, all over the world, rule their countries is about to take place.</p>
<p><strong>More nations are joining together and more of God’s children will be governed by one body.</strong></p>
<p>It is time for you to keep your eyes wide open and <strong>listen to any changes in laws, which will impoverish you</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Fight laws, which control your food supplies.</strong></p>
<p>God, My Eternal Father, will punish those evil groups should they try to starve His children.</p>
<p>This, My followers, is the <strong>time for the third Seal to be revealed</strong>.</p>
<p>Although it will not be opened for some time, I tell you this, so that you can try to prepare your food by growing your own and keeping foodstuffs, so that they will not perish.</p>
<p><strong>In time, your food will be restricted, as well as access to drinking water.</strong></p>
<p>This group, while weakening because of the power of your prayers, <strong>means to starve and poison many innocent people in an attempt to deplete the world’s population</strong>.</p>
<p>They will fight hard to bring this about.</p>
<p><strong>While they continue to inflict horror on God’s children, My Eternal Father will create ecological punishments and wipe out millions of these evil people from the face of the Earth.</strong></p>
<p>Your weather patterns will continue to change. In time, this will affect the ability to trade, so that global powers will be halted in their wicked plans.</p>
<p>Through all of this crisis, you, My Army, must pray to God the Father to protect you from these people and so that they will open up their hardened hearts to the Truth of God’s Mercy.</p>
<p>I tell you this so that you can prepare.</p>
<p><strong>These events will not take place immediately and much of this plan can be averted and mitigated through your prayers and sacrifices.</strong></p>
<p>Evil does not come from God. It arises from greed, love of self and a thirst for power and control. All of these weaknesses are spawned by Satan and placed before world leaders to tempt them, so that they can hurt God’s children.</p>
<p>Don’t let Satan’s powers control your countries.</p>
<p>Pray, pray, pray that you have the strength to oppose measures designed to make you poor, dependent and at the mercy of those who control your countries. <strong>They rule under global powers, consisting of the UK, USA, EU, China and Russia.</strong></p>
<p>I, your Jesus, will help you avoid persecution, but remember prayer will be your main weapon.</p>
<p>Prayer can stop these wicked people from taking over your ability to eat, drink, cloth yourselves and attend Christian churches.</p>
<p>Fight in My Name and I will be stand next to you at all times.</p>
<p>Your beloved Jesus</p>
