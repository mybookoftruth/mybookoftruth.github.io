		<p>My sweet child, why do you worry about the difficulties you have to face every day in this Mission? Don’t you know that All Power lies in the Hands of My Father, God the Most High? </p>
<p>When the final cleansing is being endured by humanity, it may not be pleasant, but without it souls will not be purified. This is the time when souls will have to endure the pain of Purgatory on Earth. Only those who are pure and with clean souls can enter the New Paradise that is the Kingdom of God. So<strong> instead of being fearful, I urge all of you to accept God’s Intervention in the world. Be resigned to what must be, what must take place and whatever actions are required to protect all of you from the wickedness and injustices, which will be inflicted upon the human race by those whose only allegiance is to themselves and to those who are agents of Satan. </strong></p>
<p>It is my Son’s desire to unite all those innocent souls who do not believe in God first. My Son knows that those who love God, but who may not accept Him, will turn to Him in time. He has confidence in those who truly love Him, but who reject His Intervention through these Divine Messages, as they also will come running to Him.<strong> It is those who do not know Him and those who refuse to accept Who He Is, that He worries about the most.</strong> <strong>So always remember that these lost souls will be the first souls, which my Son craves the most.</strong> <strong>These are the people who hurt Him the most; who cause Him terrible pain and suffering and who were the cause of His Tears of Blood, when He suffered the Agony in the Garden. </strong></p>
<p>Chastisements are sent, not merely as punishments for the sins of mankind, but as a means of bringing humanity to its senses and onto its knees in humility. <strong>When man is cleared of his arrogance, his belief in his own greatness and the mistaken belief that his power is greater than God’s, then only through such purification can he be made fit to stand before God. </strong></p>
<p>A person who is in mortal sin and who refuses to show remorse will never be able to withstand the pain of God’s Light. So, it is an Act of Mercy that God intervenes, in order to prepare that soul, so that he too can share in the Glory of God. It is because of God’s Love and His Generosity, that He will allow these difficult times, which have already commenced, to take place. Not because He wants to simply punish His children for their wickedness, but to ensure that they are made worthy of Eternal Life.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
