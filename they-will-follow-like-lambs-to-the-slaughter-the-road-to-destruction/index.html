		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, the greatest betrayal of My beloved, loyal disciples – those who will always hold firm to the Truth – will be by those followers in My Church who will fall prey to the great deceit.</p>
<p>So many people, because of their misguided loyalty, will be deceived by the imposter who will seize the reins in My Churches everywhere. Though they may feel uneasy at times, when they hear strange renditions of My Holy Word, which will not be taken in the correct context, they will follow like lambs to the slaughter, the road to destruction. They will lavish praise upon the false prophet and salute him like a great dictator and they will become as one to create a large army. This army will cause the greatest persecution upon their fellow Christians. Brother will fight brother in this terrible battle for the Truth. The number of those who will follow the unholy trinity, comprised of the false prophet, the antichrist and Satan, will be much greater than those who remain true to the Holy Word of God as it was laid down from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>You, My chosen people, who do not deviate from the Truth, will find this journey difficult. Never, for one moment in your lives, would you have imagined the terrible deceit, which you are about to witness. My enemies are well-prepared, have much influence and are well funded. They have many advantages, but they have not got, on their side, the Power of God. Not only do they not possess the Power of God, My Father, the Almighty One, but they can be struck down at any time by His Will.</strong> Sadly, they will draw many souls away from Me and I will allow this as part of the final purification of mankind. This period on Earth will be to separate the good from the wicked.</p>
<p>What do I mean by this? Surely, you will say, the good will be fooled and that this is not their fault. This is true. But, when those who say they are true Christians, accept heresy, instead of My Holy Word, they blaspheme against Me. They are well-aware of the Truth and they must be alert to My Word every second. So many of you are asleep. So many do not truly know Me, because you have no humility in your soul, so proud are you of your knowledge of Holy Scripture. Many of you have failed to read the Gospels or understand what will happen before My Second Coming. You still do not know, yet, that the Truth was given to you, in the Most Holy Bible. Why do you continue to defy the Word of God, argue, reject and fight against the Hand which created you? You are no more informed than those who crucified Me. You have no more knowledge than the Pharisees who believed that their interpretation of the Holy Word of God was superior to that of the Son of man. Because of your refusal to accept the final prophecies, you will deny Me. All your services to Me will mean nothing, for you will follow the one sent by Satan to deny you your rightful inheritance in My Paradise.</p>
<p>How you make Me weep. How you will betray Me will be reflected in the persecution which you will bring to bear on those you call your brothers and sisters, in My Name. You will become indoctrinated with lies, as others before you were, by wicked leaders and dictators of the past. Because of your lack of real love for Me, which requires great sacrifice, you will bring Me much grief and suffering. While the enemies of My Church will draw you into a web of deceit, you will sing their praises, adore and love those who hate Me and I will be forgotten.</p>
<p>Remember these Words. When you place false gods before Me, you will incur the Wrath of God.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
