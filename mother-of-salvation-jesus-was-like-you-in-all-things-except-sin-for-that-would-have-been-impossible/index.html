		<p>My dear child, <strong>seven fallen angels will attack this Mission and they will attempt to deceive God’s children from remaining true to His Remnant Army.</strong> They will appear to those who they deceive as being angels of the Light, when, in fact, they are anything but. </p>
<p>Satan’s power is very strong and his presence in the world is evident as he singles out all of his devotees, to encourage them to flaunt his presence. He does this through music, religions, which are not of my Son, Jesus Christ, and through those who pose behind so-called holy groups, who idolize the beast and his domain on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Children, you must always follow my Son, through all He taught during His Time on Earth.</strong> His Holy Word is sacrosanct and it is all that you need to know, if you are to follow His Path to Eternal Life. You must keep focused on your desire to gain Eternal Life and therefore live your lives as my Son has shown you. <strong>Never accept anything which casts doubt on His Divinity. The man who dares to declare untruths about my Son does not have the Gift of the Holy Spirit, and is therefore unworthy to define all that my Son is. </strong></p>
<p>My Son is your Divine Saviour, Who lowered Himself to become man. When He was born, the Word became Flesh and so Jesus Christ was a man, in every way. Jesus was like you, in all things, except sin, for that would have been impossible. <strong>The Son of God was sent to redeem humanity and save each of you from the death, which comes from enslavement to Satan.</strong> <strong>His Divinity is All-Powerful, All Good, All Impenetrable and to deny His Divinity is to deny the Power of God. When you do this, you are declaring your allegiance to the devil. </strong></p>
<p>Children, you must recite this Crusade Prayer and call on me your Mother to protect you from the deceptions which will be placed before you, in order to encourage you to deny the Power of God.</p>
<p><b>Crusade Prayer (146</b><b>) Protection against deception</b></p>
<p><i>Dear Mother of Salvation, protect me with the Grace of protection against deceptions, created by Satan to destroy the faith of Christians. Protect us against those who are the enemies of God. Keep us safe from lies and heresy, used to weaken our love for your Son. Open our eyes to untruths, deception and every attempt we may encounter to encourage us to deny the Truth. Amen.</i></p>
<p>Thank you for responding to my call to warn you of the great deception, which will soon descend over my Son’s Church on Earth.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
