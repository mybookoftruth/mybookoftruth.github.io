		<p>My child, the suffering of my Son today, is equal to that of His suffering when He was on Earth.</p>
<p>The Pain He endured then, which caused Him the greatest torment, was not His Crucifixion, but the way in which He was rejected.</p>
<p>His Word today is rejected, just as it was then.</p>
<p>He is mocked today, in a way, which brings tears and suffering, not only to me, His beloved Mother, but to His devoted followers on Earth.</p>
<p>How hurtful it is to see how many children of God have turned away from the Holy Sacraments and the Teachings of the Church.</p>
<p>So many souls are lost. I beseech you, children, to pick up the Cross of my Son and lead by example.</p>
<p>Embrace my Son with simplicity of heart.</p>
<p>To love my Son and honour my Eternal Father, is very simple, children.</p>
<p>Never analyse the Word of my Son.</p>
<p>Simply follow His Teachings, which have never changed.</p>
<p>Listen to the Words of my Son as He speaks to you now, from the Heavens.</p>
<p>He calls you to prepare your souls for His Second Coming.</p>
<p>When He speaks with you now, He does this out of His Love for mankind.</p>
<p>His Holy Word will nourish your souls and make them strong again.</p>
<p>Do not reject His call to you now.</p>
<p>He wants to save each and every soul. But in order to do that, He must remind you of the difference between right and wrong.</p>
<p>So many of you are not being guided or informed of the grievousness of sin.</p>
<p>Tolerance in your society and within the churches, means that what many of you think is of no consequence, may well be a serious sin in the Eyes of God.</p>
<p>The Church is in great darkness at this time and has been a target of the deceiver for many years.</p>
<p>My Son must intervene and guide you now, as the schism within the Church will erupt soon.</p>
<p>Wake up, children. You must embrace the Truth.</p>
<p>The world will now change beyond recognition.</p>
<p>You have been sent many messengers in the past to prepare you for this Event.</p>
<p>These are the last warnings being given to humanity, to enable them to prepare for my Son’s Great Mercy.</p>
<p>After His <a href="/divine-mercy-chaplet/">Divine Mercy</a>, when He will open the eyes of all of mankind to witness their sins, he will give a little more time for them to seek redemption.</p>
<p>Then you will be given direction to prepare your souls for the Second Coming of Christ, my beloved Son, who will come again in Glory, as foretold.</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
