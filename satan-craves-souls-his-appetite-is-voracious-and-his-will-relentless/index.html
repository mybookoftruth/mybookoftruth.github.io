		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, all of the prophecies foretold so very long ago, and given to God’s prophets, seers and visionaries, through public as well as private revelations, will now unfold.</p>
<p><strong>The skeptic man will question the authenticity of the Word of God but when he witnesses all that was foretold in the Book of Revelation, he will become silent, because, when these events grip mankind, the only solace he will find is if he seeks Me out</strong>. When your heart is full of sorrow, because of the evil acts which are carried out by wicked men against God’s children, you will weep tears of anguish. Then you will see how far evil can spread within the souls of those whose hearts are made of stone. When you see how little regard and respect these enemies of God have for human life, you will finally understand how much power the evil one exerts over humanity. <strong>In his final hours, Satan who manifests himself in the souls he fills with his putrid ways, will show the world just how  intense his hatred is for the human race.</strong></p>
<p>For every excuse given by man to justify evil, the perpetrators of wicked acts will expose the hatred they have within their hearts for God’s children. They will carry out evil atrocities in the Name of God and they will have no love in their souls. They breed hatred and most of them do not understand why their hatred for others is so intense. While many people do not believe in the existence of the evil one, you must know now that he is unable to resist revealing himself through those he infests. His vapor spreads until it devours every nation, every weak soul, and powerful leaders, whose love of ambition will render them open to his influence.</p>
<p>You will soon see evil acts taking place in every part of your society, in many nations and in different ways. Satan craves souls, his appetite is voracious and his will relentless. When his hatred is truly manifested within souls, these people will be unable to hide their actions.  Only in these situations can many of you really see the evil one for what he really is and that is through the actions of such poor souls who have subjugated themselves to his will.</p>
<p>You must never be complacent when evil acts and deeds, including wars and unrest, erupt in the world. It is then that your prayers are needed the most.</p>

<p>Your Jesus</p>
