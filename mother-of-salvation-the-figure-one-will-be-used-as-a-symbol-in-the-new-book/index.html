		<p>My dear child, the world will soon be presented, by the enemies of my Son, with a wicked book, which will have the number one embedded within its cover in red and black with the head of a goat hidden within its design. </p>
<p>To those who are none the wiser, this book will be claimed to be an important publication, which will unify the world. It will be seen to be the greatest source in bringing about world unity and it will encourage all those who read it to adapt to a new way of thinking; a new way of believing in yourself; of being kind to yourself; so that you can join, as one, with others who follow this path towards self-glorification. This book will become a doctrine to unite all nations; all religions; all politics; all rules and economic views. It will be used to create a new one-world society, devoid of religions which honour my Son, Jesus Christ. It will be part of school curriculums and all governments will be encouraged to adapt its philosophy, as part of the constitutions of their countries.</p>
<p>The figure one will be used as a symbol in the new book and people will wear badges, in order to publicly declare their allegiance to this one-world alliance. All will be ready, so that when the antichrist rises, the book will be seen to play a part in his dictatorship. The book will endorse every false doctrine; every falsity in the Eyes of God; untruths and a dangerous philosophy, which will lead all those who accept its contents into grave error. People’s ability to discern right from wrong will be weakened because of it. Their morality will be called into question and paganism, disguised as a religion that welcomes all, will be cunningly woven into every paragraph.</p>
<p>Many people will want to buy this book, because it will be declared to be such an astonishing breakthrough in the world of politics. It will become a book, which promotes a form of communism, but it will be seen as something with a unique spirituality, which will touch the hearts of many. It will be everything that is the opposite to the True Word of God. It will be a book, which sets out to evangelise the world into believing in the importance of humanism. It will glorify mankind; man’s intelligence; man’s progress; man’s great scientific strength and the importance of controlling all countries in the same way.</p>
<p>All is being planned to ensure that the antichrist will be welcomed amid great celebrations. For make no mistake, this book will be masterminded by he who will declare himself king of the world. And all peoples will be excited about a new world; a new beginning and a new leader. In time, he will be welcomed into my Son’s Church with the book of heresy. And when he sits on the throne in the new temple, all will treat him as the Christ. Shortly afterwards, he will fool the world into believing that he is my Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>That will be the time of a great many tears – tears, which will be spilt from Heaven because of the deceit, which will involve so many people. All these preparations have begun and so God also prepares to fight for those who fall under the influence of the antichrist. Prepare well, dear children, for you will need every help from Heaven to help sustain you during the times ahead.</p>
<p>Move forward with hope, because that period will be short, as God will not permit the beast to reign for any longer than is necessary, according to Holy Scripture. Trust, hope and be grateful for being given the Truth now, for this is how you will be able to prepare. Give thanks always to God for such Mercies, for He is so Generous that the more you call on Him, through His beloved Son, the more He will dilute the impact of such trials.</p>
<p>Your beloved Mother</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
