		<p><strong>My dearly beloved daughter, the schism I spoke of has begun in the Catholic Church.</strong></p>
<p>My Teachings, which have never changed since My Holy Scriptures ended with the Book of Revelation, are now being challenged.</p>
<p>There have been a number of challenges, opinions and theological assessments of My Holy Word throughout the centuries.</p>
<p>Many fine men questioned the instructions and the Teachings, which I imparted to mankind.</p>
<p>Some of My Teachings were taken apart, analysed, new interpretations sought and then accepted.</p>
<p><strong>Yet this has been unnecessary, for the Truth was given to man by the prophets who came before Me and then by Me during My time on Earth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truth has never changed. The Truth is simple.</strong></p>
<p>Other information, not contained in Holy Scripture was given, as a Gift to the world, through chosen souls, for one reason only. To help you contemplate on My Sacrifice for mankind and to show and remind you of the Love I hold in My Heart for all of God’s children.</p>
<p><strong>Any Divine Revelations given to the world today are to help you prepare for Eternal Life.</strong></p>
<p>My Teachings, honoured by the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, are now being attacked in the first of many challenges, which will result in the division of the Church.</p>
<p><strong>New laws will be introduced to suit modern opinion</strong> and so that they sit comfortably with those who, with pride in their souls, feel a need to pacify mankind, rather than show obedience to the Teachings of the Church.</p>
<p><strong>I Am the Church. The Church was founded by Me and it can never die.</strong></p>
<p>Many, including those from within, as well as from outside the Church, will attempt to break down its structure.</p>
<p><strong>Pray that My Holy Vicar, Pope Benedict XVI, will remain strong amidst the opposition he now faces.</strong></p>
<p>This is a deliberate attempt, by <strong>those connected with the false prophet, to create a new church</strong>.</p>
<p>These cunning people will have you believe it will be the same Church, but it cannot be.</p>
<p><strong>How can My Church, with new laws, twisted versions of the Truth I gave to the world, represent Me?</strong></p>
<p><strong>It can’t. This is why My Father will direct His Church, the true, loyal believers, from the Heavens.</strong></p>
<p>He will hold the keys, until the Second Coming, <strong>when the New Jerusalem will rise, the One True Catholic Church, out of the ashes to be reclaimed by all of God’s children, all religions, all creeds as one</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the way it was meant to be in full and final union in the New Era of Peace on Earth.</p>
<p>Your beloved Jesus Christ</p>
