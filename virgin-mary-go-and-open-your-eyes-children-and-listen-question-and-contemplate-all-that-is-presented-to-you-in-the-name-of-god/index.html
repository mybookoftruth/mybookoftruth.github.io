		<p>My child, as the roar of Satan and his demons get louder, and the pitch of their screams, heard in the Heavens, I must warn God’s children to open their eyes.</p>
<p>Look around you and what do you see?</p>
<p><strong>Unrest, arguments, despair and fighting, all this has been ignited by the evil spirits, that surround humanity.</strong></p>
<p>Released from Hell, their numbers are great. Not for one moment will they ease their torment, spewed out by the hatred they have for all of God’s children.</p>
<p><strong>These fallen angels were jealous when my Father, God the Most High, Created mankind and the universe.</strong></p>
<p>Their pride and disgust led to their downfall and they were cast out into Hell.</p>
<p><strong>Led by Satan, their hatred was manifested when I brought the Son of man, the Saviour of mankind, into the world. Their hatred of me surpasses anything known to humanity.</strong></p>
<p>As Queen of all the Angels, this drove them into turmoil. They knew there would be no return to the Divine Hierarchy.</p>
<p><strong>To hurt God, my beloved Father, they want to destroy that which is closest to His Heart, His precious and beloved children.</strong></p>
<p>By seducing His children, through the temptations of sin, they steal souls.</p>
<p>My Father will not tolerate this wickedness, and the time is close for these fallen angels to be finally cast into the furnace. They know this.</p>
<p><strong>Under the direction of Satan they now increase their plans and every second of the day they cause havoc in the world.</strong></p>
<p>God’s children must know that their plan is to snatch everything, which is precious to God, the Almighty Father.</p>
<p><strong>This is why they target His Holy Churches on the Earth first.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When they infiltrate God’s Churches, they infiltrate God’s children.</strong></p>
<p>Wake up, children, to what is happening before your eyes. You must stay alert at all times.</p>
<p>Pray, pray, pray that you are blessed with the Graces to recognise evil when it is presented to you as being part of God’s plans, when it is not.</p>
<p>It will take strong faith and acceptance of the Truth, contained within these Messages from Heaven, to stay on the True Path to Eternal Life.</p>
<p><strong>Eternal life is to be welcomed, children, and must never be rejected in favour of false promises.</strong></p>
<p><strong>These false promises are presented to the world in these times by those who lead your nations, and who may be influenced by the king of lies.</strong></p>
<p>Go and open your eyes, children, and listen, question and contemplate all that is presented to you, in the Name of God.</p>
<p>Your beloved Queen of Peace</p>
<p>Mother of Salvation</p>
