		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, how I thirst for the love of man and how they thirst for Me. But, the division that separates man from Me, The Giver of Life, is the greatest enemy of the human race.</p>
<p>Satan, whose cunning deceitful ways has meant  he creates great divisions in the world. That he is hidden, gives him great power over men’s souls. His evil influence creates doubts about My Existence in those with little faith. He convinces others, who do not believe in Me, that man is responsible for whatever choices he makes. His soothing influence, as he tempts man, convinces those he gains access to that wrong is right and right is wrong. He presents love as lust; hatred as a form of desire; and envy and jealousy as a means by which to justify the destruction of another person’s life.</p>
<p>Every idea, every desire, every longing and craving he plants in the souls of men, leads them into sin. So much infestation amongst mankind, at this time, has meant that pure love, which comes from God, has been replaced with lust.  Everything, which springs from the serpent, will be presented within the hearts of the sinner as being a good thing. Sin, is always justified by sinners who succumb to the devil. <b>Sin, once justified, is then glorified until it resembles a great act – worthy of recognition</b>.</p>
<p>Woe to the man who dares to challenge those who glorify sin. The sinner who embraces sin, with great rejoicing, will influence others to do the same. Today, the influence of the evil one can be seen everywhere. Whereas once, sinful acts were carefully hidden, now they have no shame in presenting them for the world to witness. All that is abhorrent to Me is being embraced with great relish. <b>Wrong is presented as being right and all that is right, according to the Laws of God, is deemed to be wrong.  When the devil is at work, everything will be presented back to front and the exact opposite to that, which comes from Me</b>.  Know that when My Word is declared to be wrong that the influence of the evil one has reached its peak.</p>
<p><b>Remember that after the Second Coming, Purgatory will not exist</b>. Heaven and earth will become one and Hell will become the dwelling place for those, who idolise the devil, and all that comes from him. The fumes of his evil and wicked ways have infested both those who believe in Me, as well as those who reject Me. No one is safe.</p>
<p>Prayer, My beloved followers, is your refuge. Uphold My Word and pray, not for yourself, but for those who have entered into a contract with the evil one. They need your prayers, morning, noon and night.</p>

<p>Your Jesus</p>
