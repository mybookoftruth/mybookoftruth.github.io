		<p>My dearly beloved daughter, when the prophets of old were called upon by God to proclaim the Truth, they were not – any of them – overly enthusiastic with the Chalice of the True Word of God given to them. It was so overwhelming for each of them – most of whom were not learned in the Words of Scripture – much of what was given to them did not make sense to them. Yet the Power of the Holy Spirit drew them and this enabled them to speak the Word of God, exactly as it was given to them. Many cowered in fear. Some walked away. Those who walked away came back. When God sends a prophet, it means that something of great significance is planned by Him. Prophets, messengers from God, only reveal to the world that which is necessary for the salvation of souls.</p>
<p>My daughter,<strong> let it be known that this Mission will be the one when the Voice of God will be felt, as if it were like thunder, which will be felt in every part of the Earth.</strong> Much will be revealed to God’s children before the Great Day of the Lord dawns. <strong>It is necessary that this happens, for were He not to warn humanity, then He would not fulfill His Promise made to the prophets – Moses, Daniel and John.</strong> When God makes a Promise it is always fulfilled.</p>
<p>Never fear a true prophet, for they speak the Words put into their mouths by God for your sake.</p>
<p>To hear the Word of God spoken today can cause fear. It can be overwhelming and cause a certain amount of anxiety. Yet, without the Word being revived, made to breathe again and live amongst you, you would find the gap – the distance between you and God – too wide. The gap closes now, as My Words, brought to you by My Father, will bring you comfort – more joy than sorrow, more courage than fear and more solace than weeping.</p>
<p>Listen carefully to this, My daughter. You must never try to push Me away when all I want to do is wrap all of you within My Sacred Arms and draw you into My Heart. My Word can be somber, My prophecies difficult to hear and the wicked deeds of man upsetting to witness, but never forget that all these things will pass. They will be forgotten. They will be of little consequence. For the world, the life ahead of you, will bring with it great joy and laughter, as the Love of God will be felt in every place, every home, every soul and every heart.</p>
<p><strong>This is the final part of My Plan to salvage the Earth and every living creature.</strong> It will present many difficulties and trials. Man’s cruelty will be the most distressing of all to withstand and the rejection of Me, Jesus Christ, the final straw in the Eyes of My Father. Yet this final confrontation will not take long before man will be relieved of the terrible hatred, which exists in the world.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Heaven is not to be underestimated, because My Father’s Intervention will be too powerful for His enemies to withstand.</strong> So be at peace. Accept God’s Intervention – His Great Act of Love, given to you by the Word, which comes from the mouth of His prophets. All these things are to protect you, bring you closer to Me and create a New Beginning where there will be no end.</p>
<p>Your Jesus</p>
